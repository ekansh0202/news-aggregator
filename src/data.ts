        "title": "The Impact and Evolution of Live TV Coverage in Modern Media",
        "body": "In the fast-paced digital world, live TV coverage has become an integral part of our daily lives. From breaking news to sporting events and cultural celebrations, live broadcasts connect audiences worldwide, delivering real-time updates and fostering a sense of shared experience. This article delves into the significance, evolution, and future trends of live TV coverage while exploring its role in shaping the modern media landscape.\n\nWhat Is Live TV Coverage?\n\nLive TV coverage refers to the real-time broadcast of events as they happen. Unlike pre-recorded shows or programs, live coverage offers unedited and instantaneous content to viewers. This immediacy makes it a preferred medium for significant events such as:\n\nBreaking news stories (e.g., elections, natural disasters, or major announcements) Sports tournaments like the FIFA World Cup or the Olympics Entertainment events, such as award shows and concerts Cultural or political happenings, such as royal weddings or inaugurations\n\nThis \"live\" nature of TV coverage creates a unique blend of spontaneity and authenticity, keeping audiences engaged and informed.\n\nThe Importance of Live TV Coverage\n\nLive TV coverage is far more than just a form of entertainment. It holds immense value in various aspects of society:\n\n1. Real-Time Information Dissemination\n\nOne of the primary benefits of live TV coverage is its ability to deliver information instantly. For instance, during crises like hurricanes or pandemics, live broadcasts provide critical updates that help people make informed decisions. The sense of immediacy ensures that news reaches a broad audience without delays.\n\n2. A Platform for Shared Experiences\n\nLive TV coverage fosters unity by creating shared moments among viewers. Sporting events, such as the Super Bowl or World Cup finals, bring millions of people together, transcending geographical and cultural barriers. These shared experiences enhance engagement, sparking discussions across various social platforms.\n\n3. Transparency and Credibility\n\nLive broadcasts often hold a higher degree of credibility since they are unedited. Audiences trust live coverage for its authenticity, especially during critical events like press conferences or debates. The absence of post-production editing lends a sense of transparency, reinforcing trust in the media.\n\nThe Evolution of Live TV Coverage\n\nThe concept of live broadcasting has undergone remarkable transformations since its inception. Let's explore the key milestones that have shaped live TV coverage:\n\n1. The Early Days of Live TV\n\nIn the mid-20th century, live TV was a groundbreaking innovation. Iconic moments, such as the moon landing in 1969, brought the world together in awe. These early broadcasts laid the foundation for modern live coverage, demonstrating its potential to captivate audiences.\n\n2. Rise of Satellite Technology\n\nThe advent of satellite technology in the 1980s revolutionized live TV coverage by enabling global broadcasts. Events like the Olympics or international political summits could now be streamed worldwide, transforming how people consumed live media.\n\n3. The Digital and Streaming Revolution\n\nThe 21st century witnessed a digital shift in live TV coverage. Platforms like YouTube Live, Facebook Live, and Twitch blurred the lines between traditional TV and online streaming. Audiences could now access live content across various devices, ensuring unparalleled convenience and reach.\n\n4. High-Definition (HD) and 4K Broadcasting\n\nWith technological advancements, live coverage has become more immersive. High-definition and 4K broadcasting have enhanced the visual quality of live events, making them more engaging and lifelike for viewers.\n\nThe Role of Live TV Coverage in Marketing and Branding\n\nLive TV coverage isn't just about information and entertainment -- it's also a powerful marketing tool. Brands leverage live broadcasts to enhance visibility and connect with audiences in real-time. Here's how:\n\n1. Sponsorships and Advertisements\n\nAdvertisers capitalize on live events to showcase their products and services. For instance, the Super Bowl is renowned for its high-profile commercials that often generate as much buzz as the game itself.\n\n2. Event Coverage for Brand Promotion\n\nLive coverage of brand-sponsored events -- such as product launches or charity initiatives -- helps companies generate excitement and foster positive brand associations. Apple's live-streamed product unveilings are a prime example.\n\n3. Enhanced Engagement Through Interactive Features\n\nModern 실시간TV중계 often incorporate interactive elements, such as live polls, Q&A sessions, or social media integrations. These features engage viewers, creating memorable brand experiences.\n\nChallenges Facing Live TV Coverage\n\nWhile live TV coverage offers numerous benefits, it also faces significant challenges:\n\n1. Technical Issues\n\nLive broadcasting is vulnerable to technical glitches, such as poor audio quality, signal disruptions, or camera malfunctions. Such issues can impact the viewer experience and damage a network's credibility.\n\n2. Competition from Online Platforms\n\nStreaming services and social media platforms are competing with traditional TV networks for live content.

        "title": "The World Cup: A Chance for Diplomacy Through Sport - News Directory 3",
        "body": "The world of sports has always held a unique power to captivate and unite. From the roar of the crowd at a packed stadium to the shared joy of victory, athletic competition transcends borders and cultures. But can this unifying force truly bridge the chasm of political divides? Recent events, like the 2022 FIFA World Cup hosted by Qatar, have sparked debate about the potential for sport to act as a catalyst for diplomacy.While the tournament faced criticism for its human rights record and political controversies, it also showcased the power of sport to bring people together.\n\nAt its core,sport offers a common ground for people from diverse backgrounds. The shared passion for a team, a player, or a particular game can foster a sense of camaraderie and understanding. This was evident during the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where fans from rival nations came together to celebrate the beautiful game, setting aside political differences for a brief but powerful moment.\n\nThe influence of sport extends beyond the playing field. Sporting events can serve as platforms for dialogue and cultural exchange. the Olympic Games, for example, have long been a symbol of international cooperation and understanding.\n\nhosting international sporting events can be a strategic tool for nations seeking to improve their global image and foster diplomatic relations.\n\nWhile the potential for sport to promote diplomacy is undeniable, it's crucial to acknowledge the challenges.\n\nPolitical Manipulation: Sport can be easily manipulated for political gain. Governments may use sporting events to promote their agendas or distract from domestic issues.\n\nHuman Rights Concerns: As seen with the 2022 FIFA World Cup, hosting sporting events in countries with questionable human rights records can raise ethical dilemmas.\n\nCommercialization: The increasing commercialization of sport can overshadow its unifying potential, turning it into a platform for profit rather than peace.\n\nDespite the challenges, the future of sport diplomacy holds promise.\n\nGrassroots Initiatives: Many grassroots organizations are using sport to build bridges between communities and promote understanding.\n\nTechnology's Role: Virtual reality and other technologies can connect people from different cultures and backgrounds through shared sporting experiences.\n\nAthlete Activism: Athletes are increasingly using their platform to speak out on social and political issues,raising awareness and inspiring change.\n\nThe Olympic Truce, a tradition dating back to ancient Greece, aimed to ensure safe passage for athletes and spectators during the Games.\n\nSport has been used as a tool for peacebuilding in conflict zones, helping to rebuild communities and foster reconciliation.\n\nQ: Can sport truly solve political conflicts?\n\nA: While sport can't single-handedly solve complex political issues, it can create a space for dialogue, understanding, and cooperation.\n\nQ: What are some examples of sport diplomacy in action?\n\nA: The ping-pong diplomacy between the US and China in the 1970s, and the shared passion for football uniting fans from rival nations during the World Cup are notable examples.* Q: How can individuals get involved in sport diplomacy?\n\nA: Support organizations that use sport for peacebuilding, participate in intercultural sporting events, and use your voice to advocate for the positive power of sport.\n\nwhile the potential for sport to facilitate diplomacy is undeniable, navigating it's complexities requires careful consideration. Harnessing its power effectively necessitates a commitment to ethical practices, addressing human rights concerns, and prioritizing genuine cultural exchange over political manipulation or commercialization. The future of sport diplomacy hinges on collaborative efforts from governments, organizations, athletes, and individuals worldwide. By embracing grassroots initiatives, leveraging technology to connect diverse communities, and empowering athlete activism, we can strive to create a more inclusive and peaceful future where sport truly bridges divides, fostering understanding and unity on a global scale.\n\nWhat are yoru thoughts on this topic?

        "title": "Sneak Preview: Beat the Clock - How to Deliver Five-Nines Sports Streams at Scale",
        "body": "On Tuesday, February 25, Jason Thibeault of Streaming Video Technology Alliance will moderate the Streaming Media Connect panel \"Beat the Clock: How to Deliver Five-Nines Sports Streams at Scale.\"\n\nWhen large-scale sports streams fail to meet expectations, folks can't stop talking about it. Any sports streaming workflow is only as strong as its weakest (or least-tested) link. The more lucrative the license and massive the stream, unfortunately, the larger the opportunity and the smaller the margin for error. So, what do the experts say about the architectural demands and challenges of maintaining five-nines uptime and broadcast quality when the stakes are too high to let either suffer? And what solutions do they recommend?\n\nConfirmed panelists include:\n\nJason Thibeault is the CEO of the Streaming Video Technology Alliance. The SVTA has several working groups that directly deal with CDN technologies, like Open Caching, or address CDN-related topics such as scalability (Networking & Transport), performance measurement (Measurement/QoE), and latency (Low Latency Streaming).\n\nWhen the SVTA launched its Sports Streaming Council in 2024, Thibeault said, \"Live sports streaming has some very unique technical challenges to ensure a high-quality viewer experience. We want to capture those so that our working groups, and other organizations, can address solutions which will improve the viewing experience for streaming sports regardless of platform.\"\n\nWill Law is Chief Architect within the Cloud Technology Group at Akamai and a leading media delivery technologist, involved with streaming media on the Internet for the last twenty years. Currently focusing on Media Over QUIC, WebTransport, low latency streaming, MPEG DASH, CMCD, CMSD and CAT, Law is Co-Chair of the W3C WebTransport Working Group and the CTA Common Media Client Data Working Group and past President of the DASH Industry Forum and Chairman of the CTA WAVE Project. He holds Masters degrees in Aerospace Engineering and an MBA and prior to Akamai worked for a series of engineering and media-related startups.\n\n\"Five nines of reliability should not be our target. It's not high enough for critical, single path components in a delivery system,\" Law says. \"Robust delivery systems need higher levels of reliability, which can only practically be achieved through redundant combinations of less reliable components. The science of redundancy, rapid failure detection and failover along with monitoring, are critical to the successful operation of highly scalable systems. Additionally, capacity must be carefully mapped and planned so that loads are dynamically and appropriately apportioned to networks, avoiding link congestion. The majority of the effort involved in distributing a live sporting event occurs in the preparation, not in the execution.\"\n\nSean McCarthy is Head of OTT-Broadcast Engineering at YouTube. Prior to joining YouTube, Sean spent time at Paramount, Bitmovin, and Akamai.\n\nMcCarthy contends that the keys to delivering great live events streams at scale in sports or any other area are CDN performance and collecting and analyzing real-time data. \"In most companies, not enough weight is put on CDN and delivery and people are very over-focused on encoding settings--especially when it relates to live--because if you can't deliver the bits, it doesn't matter how good they look. There's a lot of interesting deep data in the CDN logs that three or four years ago was not feasible to collect today. You can collect it, you can analyze them. There are tools that are built for high-volume, high cardinality data, and over the next couple years, companies will start weighting that those data sources more heavily.\"\n\nTom Buffolano is Head of Business Development, College Sports at The Switch. A seasoned expert in the sports broadcasting and entertainment industry, his experience spans business development and partnerships, sales and marketing, rights acquisition, programming and production, distribution, and monetization. Tom holds decades of experience growing businesses and driving new partnerships at leading media companies, including MTV Networks, CBS College Sports, LTN Global Communications, BitFire Network/Studios and LiveU. Tom co-founded and was Chairman of the SVG College Sports Summit and College Sports Media Awards. Beyond his professional achievements, Tom serves as a member of the Board of Directors for the National Blood Clot Alliance.\n\nHe points to the agility and lower CapEx of FAST platforms as an entering wedge for bringing new, niche providers into the live sports streaming market with \"customized live and related programs for fans of a particular team, league or sport [that] appeal to the right viewers - building a dedicated and highly targeted fanbase,\" Buffolano told Sport Broadcast last July. \"Another significant benefit of FAST lies in its rapid deployment and ability to enable quick adjustments. Unlike traditional broadcasting systems, which demand substantial investment in equipment and infrastructure, FAST platforms can be quickly and economically deployed using the the cloud.\"\n\nChristy Tanner is known internationally as an expert on how streaming, technology and AI are radically reshaping culture. As a leader, she transforms the world's most recognizable brands and startups into profitable multiplatform competitors. She has created visionary growth opportunities for Swerve Sports, BBC, Univision, PBS, Altice, and Outside. As a CBS Interactive executive, she launched game-changing new streaming services that established market dominance and created exponential revenue growth for the CBS News, Sports and Local divisions. She is a Board Director of Audacy, has received the Technology Leadership Award from Broadcasting & Cable, and is a UN Generation Equality Leader.\n\nAs Tanner told an audience at last year's NAB Streaming Summit during a panel on The Complex Business of Live Sports Streaming, \"To the extent that we can start to see some more experimentation with live sports and get some more data on it, we can really improve the experience and also the business model.\"\n\nOlga Kornienko is the COO and Co-Founder of EZDRM, the DRM as a Service specialist. Since 2001, Olga has driven the growth of this very international enterprise and established it's strong market branding as both a business and a technology leader. Olga is an expert on video security, security industry history, and a frequent contributor to industry publications and conferences.\n\nKornienko says that when it comes to live streaming at scale, the key to achieving five-nines uptime is going multi-cloud. \"We are in multiple clouds. That allows our customers to actually have a higher Service Level Agreement (SLA) than just an uptime guarantee [of] four nines. Because if you're in only one cloud ... if they have a guarantee of four nines, we can't give you more than that. But once you expand to multiple clouds, you can go to five nines and that is a much more comfortable place to be.\"",

        "title": "How to keep your private conversations private",
        "body": "New York (CNN) -- As we all live more of our lives online, it's important to understand who might have access to our conversations and internet searches - and to understand how to maintain privacy in an increasingly connected world.\n\nIn the days since billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency associates have blazed through various government agencies, journalists have encouraged federal government workers to contact them through end-to-end encrypted platforms, like the messaging app Signal.\n\nSignal is one of a number of relatively simple tools that can be used not only to help keep secure conversations with reporters, but also for communicating with colleagues when not discussing work projects, researching legal resources or even chatting with friends.\n\nUse personal devices and networks\n\nIt's safe to assume that anything you do on a work computer or phone could be visible to your employer, because they have the right to monitor usage of devices they own.\n\n\"You want to think about who has access to the communications that you're making if you're worried that someone might try to retaliate you for having these discussions,\" said Daniel Khan Gillmor, a senior staff technologist for the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.\n\nWith that in mind, it's a good idea to use a personal device for personal conversations and Google searches.\n\nThe same goes for using an employer's Wi-Fi network, on which they may be able to connect the dots between employee communications. Save any griping about work for your home network or your personal phone plan.\n\nOn work Wi-Fi, \"they won't necessarily see what tea you're spilling, but they will see who you're spilling it to,\" Gillmor said.\n\nSignal\n\nThere are a number of tech platforms that advertise encryption services for privacy -- including iMessage and WhatsApp -- but data security experts largely agree that Signal is the gold standard.\n\nSignal looks like a regular messaging app for texting and making phone calls. But it's owned by a non-profit, not a private company, and the app is end-to-end encrypted by default. That means that the content of a conversation is scrambled when it's traveling between the sender and receiver, so no one except the parties to the conversation can see it.\n\n\"If you show up with a warrant or a subpoena (to Signal), they have almost nothing about you that they can hand over,\" said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. On non-encrypted messaging apps, an employer or law enforcement could potentially force a platform to hand over a user's conversations via subpoena.\n\nEnd-to-end encryption itself isn't unique among messaging apps, but certain apps that offer encryption, like WhatsApp, may still have access to non-encrypted contacts and other accounts you've messaged, whereas Signal's builders can't see that information, according to Gillmor.\n\nAnd whether you use Signal or WhatsApp, experts advise turning on the \"disappearing messages\" feature that allows users to auto-delete conversations after a set period of time -- hours, or days, depending on what a user selects -- so that the conversations might not be accessible even if someone else got their hands on a user's phone.\n\nTor browser\n\nMany people are familiar with VPNs, or virtual private networks, which act kind of like a tunnel between your device and the internet that can mask where your internet traffic is coming from.\n\nVPNs can be a more private way of accessing the internet, but nevertheless, the VPN company could, in theory, be forced to hand over the information it has about your internet traffic.\n\n\"When you use a VPN, the VPN company can see all your traffic, they see where you're coming from and where you're going. So, if somebody on the other end of the transaction sees an IP address that belongs to a VPN company, they can submit a subpoena to the VPN company,\" Galperin said.\n\nThe most secure option, security experts say, is to use Tor browser. It's a browser that users can download just like Firefox or Safari, but that distributes internet traffic across a global network of different \"nodes,\" or computers, so that any one user's traffic could not be accessed from a single access point. With Tor, the websites a user visits are also blocked from viewing that user's IP address, which could allow them to be identified.\n\nIf you've used Tor and \"someone later sends a warrant to Google asking for all the searches that have been made from your home computer or your logged-in Google browser, they won't see searches for 'good journalist to leak to,'\" Galperin said.\n\nMany news organizations also have SecureDrop folders, allowing users to share encrypted documents and communications anonymously when using Tor.\n\nOther best practices\n\nSome companies have taken aggressive measures to identify employees who leak information, such as watermarking or tweaking emails so that different employees receive slightly different versions of the same message.\n\nFor that reason, security experts encourage people to be cautious about sending exact copies or photos of emails or documents. And any documents printed out could include \"printer dots,\" invisible tracking codes that can indicate the time, date and location where something was printed.\n\nAnd keep in mind that violating a non-disclosure agreement or sharing confidential information could expose you to legal risk if you are identified.\n\nStill, Gillmor said it can be a good idea to identify private channels of communication with colleagues or friends.\n\n\"Protecting our rights is a team sport,\" Gillmor said. \"Taking the time to figure out how to do some of these things and helping your friends figure out how to do these things, even if you never end up using them in more drastic ways ... is still a positive thing.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "body": "New York (CNN) -- As we all live more of our lives online, it's important to understand who might have access to our conversations and internet searches - and to understand how to maintain privacy in an increasingly connected world.\n\nIn the days since billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency associates have blazed through various government agencies, journalists have encouraged federal government workers to contact them through end-to-end encrypted platforms, like the messaging app Signal.\n\nSignal is one of a number of relatively simple tools that can be used not only to help keep secure conversations with reporters, but also for communicating with colleagues when not discussing work projects, researching legal resources or even chatting with friends.\n\nUse personal devices and networks\n\nIt's safe to assume that anything you do on a work computer or phone could be visible to your employer, because they have the right to monitor usage of devices they own.\n\n\"You want to think about who has access to the communications that you're making if you're worried that someone might try to retaliate you for having these discussions,\" said Daniel Khan Gillmor, a senior staff technologist for the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.\n\nWith that in mind, it's a good idea to use a personal device for personal conversations and Google searches.\n\nThe same goes for using an employer's Wi-Fi network, on which they may be able to connect the dots between employee communications. Save any griping about work for your home network or your personal phone plan.\n\nOn work Wi-Fi, \"they won't necessarily see what tea you're spilling, but they will see who you're spilling it to,\" Gillmor said.\n\nSignal\n\nThere are a number of tech platforms that advertise encryption services for privacy -- including iMessage and WhatsApp -- but data security experts largely agree that Signal is the gold standard.\n\nSignal looks like a regular messaging app for texting and making phone calls. But it's owned by a non-profit, not a private company, and the app is end-to-end encrypted by default. That means that the content of a conversation is scrambled when it's traveling between the sender and receiver, so no one except the parties to the conversation can see it.\n\n\"If you show up with a warrant or a subpoena (to Signal), they have almost nothing about you that they can hand over,\" said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. On non-encrypted messaging apps, an employer or law enforcement could potentially force a platform to hand over a user's conversations via subpoena.\n\nEnd-to-end encryption itself isn't unique among messaging apps, but certain apps that offer encryption, like WhatsApp, may still have access to non-encrypted contacts and other accounts you've messaged, whereas Signal's builders can't see that information, according to Gillmor.\n\nAnd whether you use Signal or WhatsApp, experts advise turning on the \"disappearing messages\" feature that allows users to auto-delete conversations after a set period of time -- hours, or days, depending on what a user selects -- so that the conversations might not be accessible even if someone else got their hands on a user's phone.\n\nTor browser\n\nMany people are familiar with VPNs, or virtual private networks, which act kind of like a tunnel between your device and the internet that can mask where your internet traffic is coming from.\n\nVPNs can be a more private way of accessing the internet, but nevertheless, the VPN company could, in theory, be forced to hand over the information it has about your internet traffic.\n\n\"When you use a VPN, the VPN company can see all your traffic, they see where you're coming from and where you're going. So, if somebody on the other end of the transaction sees an IP address that belongs to a VPN company, they can submit a subpoena to the VPN company,\" Galperin said.\n\nThe most secure option, security experts say, is to use Tor browser. It's a browser that users can download just like Firefox or Safari, but that distributes internet traffic across a global network of different \"nodes,\" or computers, so that any one user's traffic could not be accessed from a single access point. With Tor, the websites a user visits are also blocked from viewing that user's IP address, which could allow them to be identified.\n\nIf you've used Tor and \"someone later sends a warrant to Google asking for all the searches that have been made from your home computer or your logged-in Google browser, they won't see searches for 'good journalist to leak to,'\" Galperin said.\n\nMany news organizations also have SecureDrop folders, allowing users to share encrypted documents and communications anonymously when using Tor.\n\nOther best practices\n\nSome companies have taken aggressive measures to identify employees who leak information, such as watermarking or tweaking emails so that different employees receive slightly different versions of the same message.\n\nFor that reason, security experts encourage people to be cautious about sending exact copies or photos of emails or documents. And any documents printed out could include \"printer dots,\" invisible tracking codes that can indicate the time, date and location where something was printed.\n\nAnd keep in mind that violating a non-disclosure agreement or sharing confidential information could expose you to legal risk if you are identified.\n\nStill, Gillmor said it can be a good idea to identify private channels of communication with colleagues or friends.\n\n\"Protecting our rights is a team sport,\" Gillmor said. \"Taking the time to figure out how to do some of these things and helping your friends figure out how to do these things, even if you never end up using them in more drastic ways ... is still a positive thing.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "title": "Super Bowl LIX Could Be a Magnet for Cyberattacks",
        "body": "Sporting events like the upcoming Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans are prime targets for cyberattacks due to their massive audiences, extensive digital infrastructure, and the potential for high financial and reputational impact. Experts say organizers should be prepared for an onslaught of attacks leading up to and on game day, which is Feb. 9 this year.\n\nSecuring such events can be particularly challenging due to the vast array of potential attack surfaces, including ticketing systems, livestreaming platforms, in-stadium Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and valuable fan data. The New Year's Day terrorist attack in the city has only added to the concerns, and has prompted greater physical security measures in the form of increased surveillance, a significantly larger police presence than initially planned, and the use of drones and extra cameras to monitor for threats.\n\nJames DeMeo, faculty member with Tulane University's School of Professional Advancement, is an expert in sport event security, facilities, and venue risk assessment. The Super Bowl, he reminds, is a mega event that the Department of Homeland Security has designated as a Special Event Assessment Rating 1 (SEAR 1), which is the highest rating from a threat assessment standpoint. Following the Jan. 1 vehicle ramming incident in New Orleans' French Quarter, event security concerns are sure to have only heightened, he says.\n\nThe top cybersecurity concerns will include those around ransomware, malware, and phishing threats directed at critical infrastructure for the games and communication networks. \"Command center controls will be tasked with averting bad actors from infiltrating CCTV, access controls, and wireless networks while ensuring a seamless fan experience,\" DeMeo says.\n\nOther focus areas for the security team at the Super Bowl will include protecting fan payment data and monitoring social media networks for signs of potential physical threat activity. \"Law enforcement will be sharing relative and timely information with governmental stakeholders like the JTTF and the Secret Service,\" DeMeo says. Expect the DHS to monitor posts on social media platforms in real time before and during the games for conversations that indicate a threat to the event.\n\nDeMeo expects drones will play a key role on the physical security side of things as well. \"Drones are an effective risk mitigation tool for key Super Bowl security stakeholders,\" he says. \"This technology can be implemented for properly monitoring crowds, crowd management, crowd ingress/egress, and reconnaissance for potential nefarious bad actors on the exterior perimeters of the venue,\" he says.\n\nAdditionally, such technologies as biometrics and iris scans can be utilized as an effective risk mitigation tool by event security leads, he says.\n\nMike Storm, distinguished engineer at Cisco, says preparation for an event like the Super Bowl actually begins years in advance, with collaboration between a number of entities, including the host venue, the local city, a wide network of tech vendors, and government entities like the FBI. \"In the years, months and weeks leading up to the event, the cross-functional team engages in a wide variety of scenario and role-playing exercises so that should any issues arise during the event, responses are swift, coordinated, and ideally resolve the problem before it can impact the game or the fan experience.\"\n\nAs the primary network provider for the Super Bowl, Cisco has partnered with the NFL in a collaborative approach to manage threats to the game. \"This playbook,\" he says, \"is built on a few core attributes that are essential to successfully protecting an event of this magnitude -- simplicity, visibility, reliability, and protection.\" As part of the effort, Cisco has deployed a range of technologies to secure the game network, including Cisco Secure Firewall, Cisco Umbrella, Cisco Security Malware Analytics, Cisco XDR with Meraki, and Splunk Enterprise.\n\nThe NFL is also tapping Cisco's Talos threat intelligence service for real-time intelligence pertinent to the event. The goal is to safeguard game day operations and respond to potential threats during the event to prevent disruptions, Storm says. \"When it comes to large sporting events, we are looking for all types of attacks, at volume,\" he says. Many attacks are often focused on trying to degrade the experience of fans or on the misuse of data of viewers, guests, or participants of the game. \"These events are targeted by a variety of different actors, which can include ideologically or politically motivated hacktivists and state-sponsored threat actors.\" These actors employ a variety of tactics, which can include targeting sponsors to disrupt the game or misusing branding to lure viewers to click something on something malicious.\n\nStorm points to the rising use of artificial intelligence as impacting Cisco's approach to protecting high-profile events like the Super Bowl. For instance, it adds complexity, he says: \"The stakes of something going wrong with AI are incredibly high. On the other hand, it unlocks opportunities for faster, smarter security.\"\n\nMeanwhile. the proliferation of automated systems and services like \"just walk out\" payment methods and frictionless checkout systems at events like the Super Bowl present a new attack vector that security teams need to guard against. The growing digitization has enabled faster retail transactions and a host of other benefits for fans. But it also led to an explosion of non-human identities [NHIs] and shared multi-use service accounts, APIs, tokens, and access keys that are often poorly monitored or completely unmonitored, says Tim Eades, CEO and co-founder of Anetac.\n\n\"Anetac's research indicates that large-scale events like the Super Bowl represent a perfect storm for NHI vulnerabilities,\" Eades says. The combination of reliance on automated systems, rapid deployment, and the expansive network of NHIs required to support modern stadiums [has] significantly [increased] the attack surface,\" at events like the Super Bowl.\n\nEades perceives the targeting of NHIs as presenting a threat for event organizers in New Orleans and remote locations, \"Bad actors recognize that automated accounts are gateways to critical infrastructure and sensitive data such as customer information, employee data, and more,\" he says. Securing such accounts, Eades notes, is important because they enable attackers to potentially gain control over stadium systems, from payment processing to manipulating environmental controls and emergency systems.",

        "title": "Which Sport Is the Most Popular in the World?",
        "body": "Sports have been a fundamental part of human culture for centuries, uniting people across different backgrounds, languages, and traditions. Whether played for recreation, competition, or national pride, sports have a unique ability to bring communities together. From local neighborhood matches to global tournaments, the love for sports transcends geographical boundaries, making it one of the most powerful social forces in the world.\n\nGiven the vast number of sports enjoyed across different continents, the question arises: which sport is the most popular in the world? Popularity can be measured in various ways -- fan base, television ratings, social media following, or participation rates. However, only one sport consistently dominates all these metrics, standing out as the global leader in terms of reach and influence.\n\nUnderstanding why certain sports gain worldwide popularity requires a closer look at historical significance, accessibility, and cultural impact. While some sports thrive in specific regions, others manage to capture the interest of billions across multiple continents. The following sections will break down the criteria for measuring sports popularity, highlight the world's leading sport, and explore the factors that contribute to its dominance.\n\nDetermining the popularity of a sport is a complex process that involves multiple factors. While some sports may have a massive fan base, others might dominate in television viewership or participation numbers. A sport's reach is influenced by historical significance, cultural traditions, and technological advancements, all of which contribute to its global standing.\n\nTo objectively analyze which sport is the most popular in the world, several key criteria must be considered. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of a sport's influence and global appeal. Below is a breakdown of the most important factors used to measure sports popularity.\n\nThese factors work together to shape a sport's dominance on a global scale. While one sport may lead in participation, another might generate the most television revenue. However, the most popular sports tend to rank highly in multiple categories, ensuring their status as international powerhouses.\n\nFor instance, television broadcasting rights and sponsorship deals significantly impact a sport's visibility. Sports that secure major broadcasting contracts often see increased engagement, leading to higher fan retention. Likewise, a strong social media presence enhances a sport's accessibility, allowing fans to connect with their favorite teams and athletes in real time.\n\nUltimately, the ability to maintain a strong presence in multiple categories determines which sport is the most popular in the world. As technology continues to evolve and fan engagement shifts towards digital platforms, the criteria for measuring sports popularity may change, but these fundamental factors will remain essential in defining global dominance.\n\nSports enthusiasts across the world have long debated which sport holds the title of the most popular. While numerous games enjoy significant regional dominance, only one sport commands an unparalleled global following -- soccer. Also known as football in most countries, soccer has established itself as the most widely played and watched sport, with billions of fans spanning continents. Its widespread appeal is evident in the massive viewership numbers for tournaments, its presence in grassroots communities, and its ability to unite people across cultures.\n\nOne of the main reasons soccer dominates the global sports landscape is its simplicity and accessibility. Unlike many other sports that require specialized equipment or designated playing areas, soccer can be played almost anywhere with minimal resources. A basic ball and an open space are enough to start a game, making it a sport that is easy to adopt in both urban and rural settings. This accessibility has contributed to its immense popularity, particularly in developing nations where expensive sports infrastructure is not always available.\n\nAnother key factor in soccer's worldwide dominance is its deep-rooted history and strong presence in international competitions. The FIFA World Cup, held every four years, is the most-watched sporting event on the planet, regularly attracting billions of viewers. Beyond the World Cup, club-level competitions such as the UEFA Champions League, English Premier League, and La Liga have further cemented soccer's status as the dominant sport. These leagues and tournaments generate astronomical revenue, showcasing the sport's economic impact and its ability to engage audiences year-round.\n\nAdditionally, soccer boasts some of the most recognized and celebrated athletes in the world. Players like Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Neymar have amassed enormous fan followings, both on and off the field. Their influence extends beyond the sport, shaping fashion, marketing, and social media trends. The presence of such global icons increases soccer's visibility and ensures its continued relevance among younger generations.\n\nThe emotional connection that soccer fosters among its fans is another aspect of its supremacy. The sport's unpredictability, dramatic comebacks, and passionate supporters create an unmatched sense of excitement. Fans develop lifelong attachments to clubs and national teams, further strengthening soccer's position as the ultimate global sport.\n\nGiven these factors, it is clear why soccer consistently ranks at the top when analyzing which sport is the most popular in the world. Its blend of accessibility, elite competition, economic impact, and cultural significance makes it the unrivaled leader in global sports.\n\nWhile soccer holds the title as the world's most popular sport, several other sports enjoy massive followings across different regions. These sports have developed deep-rooted traditions, influenced by cultural preferences, historical significance, and national pride. The popularity of a sport often depends on where it is played, with some dominating specific continents while others gain international recognition through global competitions.\n\nBelow is a table highlighting some of the most popular sports worldwide, their estimated fan base, and the regions where they have the strongest presence.\n\nCricket, for example, is the dominant sport in India, Pakistan, and Australia, with the Cricket World Cup being one of the most watched international events. Similarly, field hockey enjoys massive popularity in Europe and Asia, with strong leagues and international tournaments.\n\nTennis and basketball have gained a significant global presence, thanks to international competitions such as the Grand Slam tournaments and the NBA. The rise of digital media has further expanded their influence, allowing fans to engage with their favorite players in real-time.\n\nDespite regional preferences, these sports continue to attract millions of spectators, proving that while one sport may dominate on a global scale, many others still hold immense significance in different parts of the world. Their growth and evolution highlight the diverse nature of sports fandom and the unifying power of athletic competition.\n\nThe overwhelming popularity of soccer is no coincidence. Several key factors have contributed to its position as the most widely followed sport worldwide. Unlike other sports that require specialized equipment or designated playing spaces, soccer's simplicity and accessibility make it a game that can be played anywhere, from urban streets to rural villages. Its minimal requirements have allowed it to flourish across diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, ensuring widespread participation and fostering a deep connection with fans.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons for soccer's global appeal is its competitive structure, which includes both national and international tournaments. Events like the FIFA World Cup, UEFA European Championship, and Copa América bring together nations in fierce competition, creating moments of unity and pride. The World Cup alone draws billions of viewers, making it the most-watched sporting event in history.\n\nAt the club level, leagues such as the English Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, and Serie A have captivated audiences with their high level of competition and star-studded rosters. The presence of elite clubs, iconic players, and historic rivalries keeps fans engaged throughout the year. With matches broadcasted across multiple continents and available through various digital platforms, soccer maintains an unparalleled level of exposure.\n\nThe influence of sponsorships and media rights has further propelled the sport's dominance. Major brands invest billions in advertising, ensuring that soccer remains visible across television, social media, and merchandising. Players like Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Neymar have become global icons, transcending the sport itself and influencing fashion, endorsements, and even social causes.\n\nIn addition to its economic power, soccer's passionate fan culture plays a crucial role in maintaining its top position. Stadiums filled with chanting supporters, heated rivalries, and lifelong loyalty to clubs make soccer an emotional experience for millions. No other sport captures the same level of devotion from its followers, solidifying its status when determining which sport is the most popular in the world.\n\nThe rise of media and technological advancements has played a pivotal role in expanding the reach of sports worldwide. Over the past few decades, digital transformation has changed how fans interact with their favorite teams and athletes. Traditional television broadcasts, social media engagement, and online streaming services have revolutionized the sports industry, making it more accessible than ever before. As a result, sports that were once limited to specific regions have gained international followings, with millions of people engaging through various digital platforms.\n\nThe influence of social media has particularly transformed how fans interact with sports. Athletes can now communicate directly with supporters, share insights into their training routines, and even address controversies without relying on traditional media outlets. This direct access has strengthened the personal connection between players and fans, further fueling interest in the sport.\n\nAdditionally, the emergence of online streaming services has allowed people to watch games from anywhere in the world without being restricted by cable television subscriptions. Platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and subscription-based sports networks have made it easier for fans to follow their favorite teams, regardless of geographical location.\n\nThe future of sports media continues to evolve as technology advances. With the introduction of artificial intelligence, data-driven analytics, and even more immersive experiences, sports are set to become even more engaging for fans. While traditional methods of watching sports remain relevant, the digital landscape has undoubtedly changed the way fans consume, interact with, and support their favorite games.\n\nSports have always played a significant role in shaping cultures, fostering national pride, and bringing people together. Among the countless athletic competitions enjoyed worldwide, one sport continues to stand above the rest in terms of global reach and influence. With billions of fans, unmatched international tournaments, and widespread participation, soccer remains the most recognized and celebrated sport across continents. Its accessibility and minimal equipment requirements have allowed it to thrive in both urban and rural areas, making it a universal game for people of all ages.\n\nThe financial and commercial power of soccer also reinforces its top position. Major broadcasting rights, corporate sponsorships, and merchandising contribute to an industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Players and teams have become global brands, attracting sponsorships from leading companies and driving engagement on social media. Soccer leagues and international tournaments consistently break viewership records, proving that the sport's appeal continues to grow with each passing year.\n\nGiven its cultural significance, economic impact, and passionate fan base, there is little doubt about which sport is the most popular in the world. While other sports have regional dominance, none match the level of worldwide recognition and influence that soccer commands. As media and technology continue to evolve, the sport's ability to adapt and engage new generations ensures that its legacy will remain stronger than ever.",

        "title": "BMW iX (2025)",
        "body": "In each of the three model versions of the new BMW iX, a re-tuning of the drive system and optimised power electronics result in noticeably more spirited power delivery. The new BMW iX xDrive45 delivers a system output that has been increased by 60 kW/82 hp to 300 kW/408 hp. The added power results in a 1.0 second improvement in acceleration from zero to 100 km/h (62 mph) to 5.1 seconds. The new BMW iX xDrive60 has a power output increase of 15 kW/21 hp to 400 kW/544 hp and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.6 seconds. Both models have an electronically limited top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph).\n\nMore than ever, the new BMW iX M70 xDrive offers particularly fascinating performance characteristics. The drive of the BMW M vehicle delivers 30 kW/40 hp up to 485 kW/659 hp in My Mode SPORT and a maximum torque of 1,100 Nm (811 ft-lb), which is available when Launch Control is activated. The new BMW iX M70 xDrive accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.8 seconds. Using the \"1-foot rollout\" method, the time taken to sprint to 100 km/h (62 mph) is 3.5 seconds. The all-electric athlete's top speed is 250 km/h (155 mph).\n\nNumerous efficiency-boosting measures enable a record range of more than 701 kilometres (435 miles)\n\nLike the drive units, the high-voltage batteries used in the new BMW iX are based on the latest development status of the current fifth generation of BMW eDrive technology. The innovations also include a new battery management system that optimises efficiency. Combined with the high energy density of the high-voltage batteries used in the new BMW iX, this contributes significantly to the outstanding range compared to the competition. A new battery cell technology increases the energy content of the high-voltage battery for the BMW iX xDrive45 by around 30 per cent to 94.8 kWh. The high-voltage batteries of the other model variants provide a usable energy content of 109.1 kWh (BMW iX xDrive60) and 108.9 kWh (BMW iX M70 xDrive).\n\nThe latest, highly efficient design of the highly integrated drive units, combined with the greater energy content of the battery for the BMW iX xDrive45 and other efficiency-boosting measures, results in an increase in range of up to 40 per cent. With a WLTP range of 563 up to 701 kilometres (350 to 435 miles), the new BMW iX xDrive60 sets a new benchmark in its competitive environment. The two other variants of the new BMW iX also significantly outperform their predecessors. The range of the BMW iX xDrive45 has been increased by more than 160 kilometres (99 miles) to 490 - 602 kilometres (305 - 374 miles) according to WLTP. The WLTP values for the BMW iX M70 xDrive are 521 to 600 kilometres (324 - 373 miles).\n\nAdaptive recuperation with efficiency-optimised control\n\nWhen driving, the latest version of adaptive recuperation helps to extend range. The intelligent networking of the drive control system enables the intensity of energy recovery during acceleration and braking to be adapted to the traffic situation as determined by navigation data and the sensors of the driver assistance systems. For example, the recuperation power can be increased when approaching a junction and more energy can be fed into the high-voltage battery during deceleration.\n\nAs an alternative to adaptive recuperation, the driver can select high, medium or low braking energy recovery for all traffic situations in the BMW iDrive menu. Low recuperation corresponds to the coasting function. The BMW iX rolls along without drive torque as soon as the accelerator pedal is released. The electric drive is not energised and thus no energy is consumed from the high-voltage battery.\n\nIf required, My Mode EFFICIENT can be used to activate a particularly energy-efficient operating mode for the drive system. The MAX RANGE function can increase the range remaining before the next charging stop by up to 25 per cent by limiting the drive power and maximum speed, combined with a reduction in comfort functions.\n\nNew heat pump function, more efficient predictive heat management for the high-voltage battery\n\nAll model variants of the new BMW iX are equipped with an advanced heat pump function as standard. The new intelligent combination of heat pump technology ensures even greater efficiency in a wide range of driving situations and outside temperatures between minus 20 and plus 30 degrees Celsius for the integrated heating and cooling circuit of the interior, as well as for the heating and cooling system of the drive and high-voltage battery. For example, the waste heat from the electric motors can be used specifically to heat the interior and the high-voltage battery. This allows both the interior and the high-voltage battery to be heated simultaneously with the heat pump function and, if required, with a central electric auxiliary heater.\n\nWhen outside temperatures are low, a new storage heating function optimises the pre-conditioning of the high-voltage battery for optimum DC charging with shorter charging times and greater efficiency. Efficient use of the heat generated by the instantaneous water heater allows the high-voltage battery to heat up much faster. Anticipatory thermal management ensures that the temperature of the high-voltage battery is optimally controlled in good time before a stopover at a fast-charging station. When the navigation system is active, the battery is automatically pre-conditioned before a planned charging stop. Pre-conditioning the battery can be manually activated and deactivated by the customer at any time. The high-voltage battery can even be pre-conditioned before departure via the My BMW App.\n\nCombined Charging Unit and optimised charging software\n\nThe Combined Charging Unit (CCU) used in all model variants of the new BMW iX enables AC charging with a maximum output of 22 kW (standard for the BMW iX M70 xDrive). The CCU of the new BMW iX xDrive45 can now supply energy with an increased output of up to 175 kW at a DC fast charging station. The maximum charging power of the two other model variants is 195 kW.\n\nIn addition, the charging current control has been further developed in order to make the best possible use of the high charging capacities. The charge level of the high-voltage battery in the new BMW iX can be increased from 10 to 80 per cent of the total capacity in 35 minutes (BMW iX xDrive45: 34 minutes). Similarly, the range can be extended by 131 to 166 kilometres (81 to 103 miles) (BMW iX xDrive45), 168 to 217 kilometres (104 to 135 miles) (BMW iX xDrive60) and 152 to 182 kilometres (94 to 113 miles) (BMW iX M70 xDrive) within 10 minutes at a DC fast charging station with a battery charge level of 10 percent. The charging process can now be ended easily and conveniently with a release button in the area of the charging port.\n\nPlug & Charge Multi Contract and Connected Home Charging for maximum charging flexibility and convenience\n\nThe new BMW iX is also suitable for the Plug & Charge Multi Contract function. Plug & Charge Mulit Contract makes charging at compatible public charging stations even more convenient, as digital authentication via app or charging card is no longer required to access them. The vehicle authenticates itself independently through a technical interface. As soon as the vehicle is connected to the charging point, not only electricity but also the necessary contract data for invoicing the energy costs is transmitted through a communication interface via the charging cable. Customers can digitally store up to five individual Plug & Charge-enabled power contracts from different providers in the vehicle.\n\nThe Connected Home Charging option enables solar-, load- and cost-optimised charging at home based on a dynamic electricity tariff. The Connected Home Charging Package now also includes the new BMW Wallbox Plus equipped with comprehensive connectivity and the use of digital services to control charging processes via the My BMW App.\n\nReduced design language, enhanced sportiness\n\nWith its clear, reduced design language, the monolithic body and the proportions characteristic of a BMW Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV), the BMW iX immediately signals a particularly progressive form of driving pleasure typical of the brand. The modern presence of the new edition of the pioneer in the premium segment of all-electric luxury class models is complemented by consistently enhanced sportiness. The dynamic appearance of the new BMW iX, already emphasised as standard, is an authentic reflection of the increased drive performance achieved in all model variants. At the same time, the almost seamless design of the front and rear apron surfaces, which are painted to a high degree in the colour of the vehicle, lends a particularly precise exterior design.\n\nThe M Sport package, now available as an option for the all-electric SAV for the first time, sets a clear dynamic accent with powerful lines, distinctive air intakes and new M light-alloy wheels. An M Sport package Pro is also available for the new BMW iX.\n\nNewly designed BMW kidney grille and particularly narrow headlights\n\nThe striking front design of the SAV, designed exclusively for purely electric mobility, is characterised in particular by the redesigned BMW radiator grille with a structure of vertical and diagonal lines in its interior. Its surround is particularly finely modelled. The BMW Iconic Glow kidney grille with contour lighting, which comes as standard on the new BMW iX M70 xDrive and is available as an option for the other model variants, ensures a particularly expressive presence. The surface of the BMW kidney grille also has an additional polyurethane coating that makes it less sensitive to damage. Thanks to a special self-healing effect, light scratches can be removed within 24 hours at room temperature or within a few minutes by applying heat.\n\nAs the electric drive of the BMW iX requires very little cooling air, the BMW radiator grille is completely closed and serves as an intelligent functional surface that seamlessly integrates cameras, radar systems and other sensors behind a transparent surface. The BMW radiator grille also contains heating elements and a cleaning system for the sensors. The BMW logo on the engine compartment lid serves as a filler for the windscreen washer fluid. Otherwise, the engine compartment lid has no mechanism for opening by the customer.\n\nThe particularly slim adaptive LED headlights are another characteristic design feature of the new BMW iX. They now feature the brand's hallmark four-eyed face in the form of vertical, slightly slanted LED units for the daytime running lights and turn indicators. A Frozen Grey stripe pattern on the headlamp covers is a standard feature, echoing the structure of the BMW radiator grille and ensuring that the light sources are set off to great effect. In the M Shadow Line headlights, which are part of the M Pro Sport package and standard in the new BMW iX M70 xDrive, the stripe patters are finished in high-gloss black. The adaptive LED headlights come as standard and include the cornering light function and new city lights.\n\nPowerful profile with generous surfaces and precise lines\n\nThe clear, minimalist design language lends the side view of the new BMW iX a sporty elegance. The modern and minimalist surfaces are structured by a few precisely placed lines. Slightly rectangular wheel arches are a classic design feature of the BMW X models and emphasise the powerful profile and stable road holding. Doors with frameless glass add to the flowing appearance of the entire side window design. The new body-colour trim at the lower end of the body emphasise the monolithic appearance and elegant profile of the new BMW iX.\n\nThe flush-mounted door handles are in a contrasting colour and can be operated electrically at the touch of a button. Indirect illumination of the recessed handles provides a high-quality backdrop. An optional soft-close function makes getting in and out of the car even easier. The exterior mirrors on the BMW iX have been designed to optimise aerodynamic properties. The slim mirror bases are directly connected to the lower part of the side window frame. Their caps are finished in the car's colour. With its high-gloss black exterior mirror caps, the BMW M automobile demonstrates its refined sporting character.\n\nRedesigned rear apron, modern light signature\n\nThe powerful rear end of the BMW iX underlines its modern look with generously proportioned surfaces divided by a few distinctive lines. The luggage compartment lid extends over the entire rear section without any joints. The rear apron of the all-electric SAV has been redesigned and features an integrated diffuser element in the new BMW iX M70 xDrive and in conjunction with the M Sport package.\n\nThe wide stance of the BMW iX is further emphasised by the narrow, horizontal LED tail lights. The lights are integrated directly into the three-dimensional exterior light clusters. This creates a particularly expressive light signature with high-contrast, precise contours between illuminated and non-illuminated elements. The L-shape, typical of the brand, is given a modern interpretation in the combined rear light strip and stoplight and surrounds the direction indicator, which is also horizontally aligned and only visible when active. Reversing lights and fog lights are integrated into the lower part of the bumper, as are the reflectors. As a BMW M automobile and in conjunction with the M Sport package Pro, the new BMW iX features M Shadow Line lights and vertically arranged reflectors.\n\nLarge selection of exterior colours, BMW Individual Exterior Line Titanium Bronze as an option\n\nThere is a choice of one solid paint finish and nine metallic finishes for the body of the new BMW iX. The range also includes the new finishes Arctic Race Blue metallic, Dune Grey metallic, Carbon Black metallic, BMW Individual Frozen Deep Grey metallic, BMW Individual Frozen Pure Grey metallic, Tanzanite Blue metallic and Space Silver metallic (available from summer 2025). The BMW Individual Exterior Line Titanium Bronze is also available as an option, giving the SAV with its strong character a particularly high-quality and exclusive appearance with precisely selected colour accents.\n\nThe light-alloy wheels available for the new BMW iX feature an aerodynamically optimised design. 20-inch light-alloy wheels come as standard, while 21-inch or 22-inch M light-alloy wheels in four new variants are part of the M Sport package and the M Sport package Pro. The new BMW iX M70 xDrive underlines its position as the top sports car in the model range with exclusive and newly designed 22-inch M light-alloy wheels as standard. For the first time, 23-inch BMW Individual light-alloy wheels in a V-spoke design are now also available for the all-electric SAV. All new-alloy wheels have aluminium inserts to help reduce drag. They are combined with tyres that meet the highest A+ efficiency rating.\n\nIndividual premium ambience, luxurious interior comfort and new accents for sporty driving pleasure\n\nThe vehicle concept of the BMW iX offers ideal conditions for an interior design that focuses on spacious comfort and progressive luxury. This individual charisma is emphasised by innovative architecture, a minimalist design and materials specifically selected with sustainability in mind. The new BMW iX sets clear accents for active driving pleasure, which are reflected in the interior with the equipment and design features of the optional M Sport package.\n\nIn the BMW iX, all-electric premium mobility is closely linked with a modern, feel-good ambience in the interior. Thanks to the high-voltage battery positioned deep in the floor and the highly integrated drive units mounted directly on the front and rear axles, the absence of a fuel tank and centre tunnel creates additional interior design freedom. The driver and front passenger enjoy generous legroom, as do the three rear-seat passengers. Additional storage space is also available. The open, lounge-style interior is characterised by the free-standing BMW Curved Display, the flat instrument panel and the two-level centre console, whose design, choice of materials and colour scheme create the impression of a high-quality piece of furniture between the driver and front passenger.\n\nThe progressive interior design of the BMW iX also includes inviting functionality that puts the user first and technology second. The modern design and equipment style of the BMW iX is characterised by touch function and voice control with a reduced number of buttons and controls, loudspeakers recessed under the fabric of the door panels, filigree air vents, heated surfaces and an almost invisibly integrated projector for the BMW Head-Up Display.\n\nThree interior design options - and the new M Sport package\n\nIn addition to one standard and two optional interior design variants, the components of the M Sport package for the first time allow the interior of the new BMW iX to be specifically customised. An anthracite-coloured roof liner, a round M leather steering wheel, M pedals and M specific displays on the 12.3-inch Information Display and the 14.9-inch Control Display give the new BMW iX a sporty flair. All the design and equipment features of the M Sport package also lend the interior of the new BMW iX M70 xDrive a particularly dynamic appearance as standard.\n\nThe standard Atelier interior design of the new BMW iX includes a hexagonal steering wheel, model-specific seats with integrated headrests for the driver and front passenger and Sensatec surfaces. The seats feature a striking stitching pattern with perforated areas and are available in the colours Black, Oyster or Mocha. The stone-grey surfaces of the optional Loft trim feature a diagonally divided material and colour pattern, combining high-quality textile and microfibre fabrics with contrasting stitching and eye-catching quilting. The highlight of the Suite interior is the vegetable-tanned natural leather on the seats, instrument panel, centre console and centre armrest. This leather is available in Amido or Castanea.\n\nThe Atelier, Loft and Suite versions also feature selected accents and controls in Gold Bronze. In combination with the M sports package and in the new BMW iX M70 xDrive, they are finished in Dark Silver. This version is also available on the standard Atelier trim level in combination with an M leather steering wheel. The control panel in the centre console features a high-gloss black frame, a glass-look surface and BMW Controller as standard. The optional Clear & Bold interior applications include a control panel in FSC-certified walnut wood and controls in cut crystal glass. In conjunction with the M Sport package and in the new BMW iX M70 xDrive, the glass applications of the Clear & Bold option are combined with a high-gloss black control panel surface.\n\nNew M multifunction seats, top-of-the-range BMW iX M70 xDrive with exclusive standard equipment\n\nHeated driver and passenger seats, a heated steering wheel, the BMW Live Cockpit Professional and the Harman Kardon Surround Sound System are all standard in the new BMW iX, regardless of the interior trim chosen. Active seat ventilation is available as an option. The M multifunction seats are part of the M Sport package and standard equipment for the new BMW iX M70. Available for the first time in the all-electric SAV, these seats offer a particularly wide range of electrically operated adjustment options, including backrest width adjustment, lumbar support and pronounced contouring for optimum lateral support when cornering dynamically. The microfibre/Sensatec seats are finished in Atlas Grey/Black with M specific stitching and accents in the colours of BMW M GmbH. The new M multifunction seats are also optionally available in Amido natural leather and Castanea natural leather. As an option, they can also be combined with active seat ventilation and a massage function (standard in the BMW iX M70 xDrive).\n\nThe standard equipment of the new BMW iX also includes an alarm system, Welcome and Goodbye animation, adaptive LED headlights, Comfort Access and Driving Assistant Plus. The new BMW iX M70 embodies a fascinating combination of performance and luxury, with an interior that offers not only the contents of the M Sport package, but also exclusive design features and a particularly comprehensive range of comfort equipment for a personalised driving experience. The M leather steering wheel features the characteristic three-spoke design, contrasting stitching in the colours of BMW M GmbH and a red centre line. It is also equipped with 4-zone automatic air conditioning, solar control glazing, adaptive two-axle air suspension and Integral Active Steering as standard.\n\nAppealing options: From the Heat Comfort package to the Sky Lounge panoramic glass roof and the tow hitch\n\nThe optional active seat ventilation and Heat Comfort package, available for all model variants of the new BMW iX, contribute to maximum well-being. Heated surfaces for the instrument panel and glove compartment, the door panels, centre control armrest and the rear seats ensure a comfortable temperature for all passengers. The Sky Lounge panoramic glass roof, also available as an option, enhances the bright and spacious interior with a one-piece viewing area that extends over all seats. Instead of a roller blind, it features electrochromatic shading that can be activated at the touch of a button. The Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System, with 30 speakers and exciters in the front seats, delivers an exceptionally intense and precisely balanced sound experience.\n\nThe functionality of the spacious interior is emphasised by the 40 : 20 : 40 split rear bench seat. Its elements can be folded individually or together to increase the all-electric SAV's luggage space from 500 litres to up to 1,750 litres. An electrically extending and retracting tow hitch is also available as an option for the new BMW iX. For all model variants, the maximum permitted towing capacity is 2,500 kilograms.\n\nContinued development of BMW dynamics, comfort and safety\n\nThe BMW iX is based on an independent vehicle concept that is consistently designed for all-electric mobility and at the same time for a harmonious driving experience typical of the BMW brand. The extreme structural rigidity of the body and chassis, the balanced weight distribution and low centre of gravity, as well as the large wheel sizes and track widths, enhance the agility and cornering dynamics of the SAV. The suspension technology of the BMW iX includes a double-wishbone front axle, a five-link rear axle, a stroke-dependent damper system and electric steering with Servotronic function and variable ratio. It guarantees superior driving pleasure and maximum rolling and acoustic comfort. The new BMW iX M70 xDrive also features adaptive two-axle air suspension with electronically controlled shock absorbers including M specific tuning and M specific anti-roll bars, Integral Active Steering and a sports brake system with red-painted brake callipers. Adaptive two-axle air suspension and Integral Active Steering are also available as an option for the new BMW iX xDrive45 and the new BMW iX xDrive60. A sports brake system with blue brake callipers is part of the optional M Sport package for these model variants.\n\nIn the new version of the all-electric SAV, the suspension, damping and chassis control systems have been fine-tuned to cope with the increased drive power and weight balance resulting from optimised battery technology. In addition, a hydraulic rear axle support bearing ensures an optimised balance between sporty dynamics and ride comfort. Weight- and friction-optimised wheel bearings and tyres with reduced rolling resistance also contribute to the increased efficiency of the new BMW iX.\n\nThe Hill Descent Control (HDC) function is available as standard in the new BMW iX for safe driving on roads and paths with steep gradients. It can be activated by pressing the My Car button in the driver assistance systems menu. The hill descent control limits the speed of the electric SAV to a fixed value set by the driver between 3 km/h (1.9 mph) and 30 km/h (17 mph) without the need to use the brake pedal. The new BMW iX also offers the option of deactivating the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) in the suspension settings menu.\n\n23-inch BMW Individual light-alloy wheels available for the first time\n\nThe new BMW iX comes on 20-inch light-alloy wheels as standard. 21-inch or 22-inch M light-alloy wheels are part of the M Sport package and the M Sport package Pro. The new BMW iX M70 xDrive comes with 22-inch M light-alloy wheels in an exclusive design as standard. For the first time, 23-inch BMW Individual light-alloy wheels are also available as an option for the new BMW iX. The 22-inch and 23-inch wheels are combined with tyres with integrated foam absorbers to optimise noise comfort.\n\nWide variety of systems for automated driving and parking\n\nJust like the chassis technology, the automated driving and parking technology in the new BMW iX helps to provide the customer with a comfortable, emotionally powerful and harmonious driving experience in every situation. Its advanced assistance systems offer support with driving tasks, provide relief in monotonous traffic situations and help to prevent accidents.\n\nTo optimise comfort and safety, the new BMW iX offers a wide range of systems for automated driving and parking.

The advanced modular technology kit gives the new BMW iX outstanding intelligence in environmental monitoring and data processing. It also offers the potential for extensive integration of new and enhanced functions. These updates and enhancements can be installed over-the-air via remote software upgrades or downloaded from the BMW ConnectedDrive Store. This means that the BMW iX and its software remain conveniently at the cutting edge of technology.\n\nHighway Assistant for optimised comfort on long journeys\n\nThe new BMW iX is already equipped with Driving Assistant Plus as standard. In addition to front collision warning with brake intervention, Lane Change and Lane Departure Warning and Speed Limit Info traffic sign recognition with no-overtaking indicator, it also includes Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function and Steering and Lane Control Assist, each of which can be used at speeds of up to 180 km/h (112 mph), as well as Active Speed Limit Assist. The optional Driving Assistant Professional also includes Evasion Assistant, Road Priority Warning, Wrong-way Warning, the Active Lane Change and Threading Assis and, depending on the market, traffic light detection, Emergency Lane Assist and Emergency Stop Assistant. Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function is also available at speeds of up to 210 km/h (130 mph).\n\nThe BMW Highway Assistant is the highlight of the range of options for automated driving. Its Level 2+ functionality allows drivers in Germany, the USA and Canada to take their hands off the wheel and comfortably position themselves on dual carriageways with separate lanes at speeds of up to 130 km/h (81 mph) while keeping a close eye on the traffic. The system also includes the unique Active Lane Change Assistant with eye activation. The combination of these two functions ensures outstanding driving comfort on long journeys with the new BMW iX.\n\nParking and manoeuvring can be controlled by smartphone\n\nParking Assistant, including Reversing Assistant and Reversing Assist Camera, also comes as standard in the new BMW iX. The optional Parking Assistant Professional adds the functions Surround View including Top View, Panorama View and 3D View, as well as the BMW Drive Recorder and Anti-Theft Recorder.\n\nWhat's more, Parking Assistant Professional allows you to control the parking manoeuvre from outside the car using a smartphone. The Manoeuvre Assistant can also automatically complete more complex manoeuvres up to 200 metres (656 ft) in length. The Trailer Assistant is also part of the Parking Assistant Professional.\n\nIntuitive user experience and advanced digital services\n\nThe BMW iX is also a pioneer in the field of display and operating systems. It was the first production vehicle to be launched on the market with the innovative BMW Curved Display. BMW iDrive with QuickSelect, based on the BMW Operating System 8.5, contributes to the advanced driving and travelling experience in the new BMW iX. With the BMW Curved Display and the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, it is consistently geared towards operation via touch functions and natural speech.\n\nThe BMW Operating System 8.5 start screen permanently shows the map view of the navigation system or other individually configurable displays. On the driver's side, the screen displays vertical live widgets that can be selected with a swipe, and QuickSelect makes it easy to activate them without having to go to a submenu. Once the settings have been made, it is again sufficient to tap the Home symbol at the bottom of the display to return to the start screen. In addition to the Home symbol, there are now icons for direct access to the air conditioning menu, the All Apps menu as well as Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™, if activated. In addition, the BMW iDrive in the new BMW iX offers the prerequisites for using digital services such as audio and video streaming as well as in-car gaming.\n\nThe BMW Live Cockpit Professional is part of the standard equipment of the new BMW iX. It includes the BMW Head-Up Display and the Augmented View function on the Information and Control Display.\n\nWith the BMW Operating System 8.5, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant also gains additional capabilities, including in the areas of communication, navigation and vehicle control. It is also possible to integrate Amazon Alexa. The Alexa voice service can be used in the vehicle, for example, to make shopping lists using your voice, play music or control your smart home remotely.\n\nBMW Maps navigation system with charging-optimised route planning\n\nThe BMW Maps cloud-based navigation system, which is part of BMW Live Cockpit Professional, offers even better functions for charging-optimised route planning on long journeys in the new BMW iX. This can be done either in the vehicle or in the My BMW App on the smartphone and then sent to the navigation system of the new BMW iX. Charging stops are planned in such a way as to arrive at the destination as quickly as possible. The driver's preferred charging status, with which he wants to reach the stopovers and the final destination, can be set. On request, detailed information can be provided on the charging stations accessed during the journey, such as availability, costs and the infrastructure in the vicinity.\n\nThe closer the vehicle gets to a scheduled stopover, the more frequently the availability of the charging station is checked so that an alternative route can be determined in good time if necessary. If the driver spontaneously decides to make an individual charging stop along the way, the planning of the rest of the route is automatically adapted to the new conditions.\n\n\"Over-the-air\" updates: Remote Software Upgrade and BMW ConnectedDrive Upgrades\n\nTo ensure that the new BMW iX always has the latest software, updates can be installed \"over the air\". Remote software upgrades can include free quality or functional improvements.\n\nIn addition customers can purchase further driver assistance, entertainment and personalisation features through BMW ConnectedDrive Upgrades (availability varies by country, vehicle model, equipment and vehicle condition). Selected functions can be tested free of charge for a period of one month and then booked for a specific term. The range on offer in the BMW ConnectedDrive Store includes the BMW Highway Assistant and Parking Assistant Professional, Welcome Light Animation and innovative entertainment services.\n\nVideo streaming and in-car gaming on the control display\n\nThe BMW Operating System 8.5 enables a wider range of digital content for information and entertainment, faster update cycles for functions and optimised access to many specific online services. For video streaming on the Control Display, the Connected Package Professional offers YouTube as well as a video app for local and international channels. The entertainment offering includes both live channels and on-demand media libraries in the categories of news, sport, children's entertainment, movies and series.\n\nThe latest generation of BMW iDrive also offers an innovative form of in-car gaming with the AirConsole platform. When the vehicle is stationary, the driver and passengers can play casual games alone or in multiplayer mode, for example to pass the time while the BMW iX's high-voltage battery is charging. Players only need their smartphone, which acts as a controller, and the BMW Curved Display. The selection of playable titles such as \"UNO® Car Party!\", \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" or \"Starlit Kart\" is constantly being expanded.\n\nPersonalised user experience with BMW ID, My BMW App and personal eSIM, BMW Digital Key Plus as standard\n\nThe standard equipment of the new BMW iX includes optimised smartphone integration via Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™. In selected markets, 5G mobile phone reception as standard provides the ideal conditions for in-car gaming, audio and video streaming and the use of other online-based services.\n\nTo personalise the user experience with BMW ID, simply log in to the vehicle for the first time using a smartphone and scan the QR code. The personal profile is then added and synchronisable settings are loaded. This means that the customer is greeted on the vehicle display by name and, if desired, with a personal profile picture, and their individual vehicle settings are automatically loaded. In addition, the vehicle is added to the My BMW App without the customer having to do anything. As a universal digital interface, it provides information on the vehicle's status, available range and service and maintenance requirements at all times. It also provides remote access to functions such as locating the vehicle and locking and unlocking the doors.\n\nThe BMW Digital Key Plus can also be set up as standard for suitable smartphones and smartwatches with iOS or Android operating systems. Using the digital key on a mobile device, the new BMW iX automatically unlocks when approached. This is made possible by ultra-wideband (UWB) radio technology. The engine can also be started without taking the device out of your pocket. This makes a conventional car key superfluous. The BMW Digital Key Plus is even easier to set up with the new Setup Card. Simply hold the card up to your smartphone or scan the QR code on the back. The BMW Digital Key Plus can be shared digitally with other people with individually definable rights and offers additional control functions via the My BMW App in the vicinity of the vehicle.\n\nHolistic concept for using resources sustainably\n\nSustainable development is an integral part of the BMW Group's corporate strategy. The Group is not only systematically driving forward the electrification of all drive systems, but is also constantly working to increase the efficiency of its entire product portfolio. In this way, the fuel consumption and emission values of models with combustion engines are continuously reduced and the energy efficiency and range of fully electric vehicles are increased, without compromising the driving pleasure typical of the brand. To achieve this goal, in 2007 the manufacturer launched BMW EfficientDynamics, a package of measures and technologies that optimises vehicle development to achieve maximum performance with minimum energy consumption. In addition to the further development of all drive systems, the comprehensive approach also includes improved energy and heat management, optimisation of aerodynamic properties, weight reduction through intelligent lightweight construction and the integration of digital efficiency functions.\n\nIn the European automotive markets, the BMW Group continued to reduce the CO2 emissions of its fleet in 2023. With a provisional value of 102.1 grams per kilometre according to WLTP, the company was able to undercut the European Union's target of 128.5 grams per kilometre by around 20 percent.\n\nIn addition, the BMW Group's holistic approach to reducing the environmental footprint takes into account the entire life cycle of the vehicle - from development, the procurement of raw materials, the use of secondary materials and production through to the use of the vehicle and its subsequent recycling. The company has set itself the goal of reducing CO2 emissions per vehicle by at least 40 per cent over the entire life cycle by 2030 compared to 2019. In addition, the BMW Group aims to achieve net zero CO2e emissions across the entire value chain by 2050 at the latest.\n\nExtended Life Cycle Assessment with the Vehicle Footprint\n\nThe new BMW iX also contributes to the BMW Group's ambitious CO2 targets through the consistent further development of BMW eDrive technology and numerous other innovations. Its environmental properties have also been further optimised in terms of efficiency. Thanks to advanced power electronics with SiC inverters and the fine-tuning of wheel bearings and tyres, among other things, energy consumption in the statutory WLTP test cycle has been reduced by more than 8 percent (best case scenario, depending on model and equipment). In the case of the new BMW iX xDrive60, this corresponds to an increase in range of around 60 kilometres (37 miles).\n\nElectric motors without rare earths\n\nThe new BMW iX is produced at the BMW Group's Dingolfing plant. The plant is not only the company's largest production site in Europe, but also the centre of competence for the production of electric drives. It supplies BMW Group plants around the world with electric motors and high-voltage storage systems for the production of all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.\n\nFor the electric motors of the current fifth generation of BMW eDrive technology, a design principle has been developed that makes the use of rare earth metals in the rotor unnecessary. Instead of magnets, which require these raw materials, a current-excited rotor is used to ensure spontaneous and precisely controllable excitation of the electric drive.\n\nThe biggest single contribution to the increased efficiency of the new BMW iX comes from the first-ever use of silicon carbide semiconductor components (SiC inverters) in a BMW electric vehicle. The use of a SiC inverter now ensures significantly more efficient energy conversion in the drive train. Semiconductors made of silicon carbide are not only more efficient, but also more powerful and significantly more temperature resistant than semiconductors made of conventional silicon.\n\nOptimised aerodynamic properties, light-alloy wheels made from 70 percent secondary aluminium, A+ efficiency tyres\n\nEfficiency and range also benefit from the outstanding aerodynamic properties, which help the BMW iX to achieve a Cx value of 0.25. The design of the light-alloy wheels has been further optimised in all dimensions. The 21- and 22-inch light-alloy wheels on the new BMW iX consist of 70 percent secondary aluminium.\n\nThe rolling resistance of the tyres has also been reduced. All tyres available for the new BMW iX now carry the highest efficiency label A+.\n\nMaterials and manufacturing processes for more sustainability in the interior\n\nThe interior of the new BMW iX also uses innovative and environmentally friendly materials and manufacturing processes to reduce the vehicle's ecological footprint. Seat surfaces in a combination of natural wool and microfiber offer a new option. Other options include interior and seat surfaces made from vegetable-tanned leather. Further optional equipment includes interior and seat surfaces made from vegetable-tanned leather. This treatment process significantly reduces the use of chemical substances.\n\nThe new BMW iX is equipped with floor mats made of 100 per cent recycled plastic in the face fabric as standard. Recycled material is also used for the face fabric of the floor panelling and for the door and tailgate panels. In addition, the optional wood used for the control panel in the centre console area is FSC-certified.\n\nCO2-optimised production at the BMW Group Plant Dingolfing\n\nAll model variants of the new BMW iX Sedan are manufactured at the BMW Group Plant Dingolfing. As with all locations in the global production network, the BMW Group's largest production plant in Europe uses only renewable energy from external providers.\n\nOther facets of sustainable production at the Lower Bavarian site include an energy-efficient plant park, intelligent packaging planning, transport logistics, recycling and water management. In addition, one of the most powerful roof-mounted photovoltaic systems in Germany will be installed at the BMW Group plant in Dingolfing by 2025. Electric trucks are being used on a pilot basis for transport within the plant site. In addition, 70 per cent of the vehicles produced will leave the plant by freight train.\n\nIn 2023, the recycling rate at the BMW Group's Dingolfing plant was 89 per cent, while the recovery rate was as high as 99.8 per cent. As a result, the plant produced only around 680 grams of residual waste per vehicle produced. In addition, around 47 per cent of the well water used by the paintshop is recycled for reuse in various processes, including recooling systems. The recycling plant saved around 77,000 m3 of fresh water in 2023. Total water consumption related to vehicle production was also reduced by 170 litres per vehicle.\n\nDesigned for recycling: Moving towards a circular economy step by step\n\nOne of the BMW Group's ambitious sustainability goals is to increase the use of secondary raw materials in vehicle production, as is already being implemented in many areas of the new BMW iX. The company is pursuing the vision of the circular economy, in which raw materials are kept in circulation for as long as possible and without any loss in quality in order to reduce the use of primary materials and the associated mining of new raw materials and their energy and CO2 intensive processing. The BMW Group is also making important contributions to the recycling of vehicles at the end of their useful life.\n\nThe BMW Group's Recycling and Dismantling Centre (RDZ) develops technologies and solutions that are then made available to the entire recycling industry. For 30 years, the RDZ has been doing important groundwork to promote recycling in the automotive industry.\n\nParallel to the market preparation for the new BMW iX, the BMW Group launched a Europe-wide partnership with SK tes, a leading provider of innovative technology life cycle solutions, in November 2024. In a special recycling process, cobalt, nickel and lithium are extracted from used batteries and then returned to the value chain for the production of new batteries.\n\nMore efficient driving with the efficiency trainer\n\nIn addition to BMW EfficientDynamics technology, an efficient driving style is a key factor in reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions during the vehicle's service life. The efficiency trainer in the My BMW App provides drivers with tips on how to optimise their driving style in terms of sustainability. The digital assistant analyses previous journeys and provides tips for improvement as well as incentives by comparing fuel consumption with corresponding values from the BMW Community.",

        "body": "Woodcliff Lake, NJ - January 28, 2025... More power, more dynamic performance, more efficiency: The new BMW iX takes the driving experience of the all-electric Sports Activity Vehicle to a new level. Consistent progress in the field of drive and high-voltage battery technology as well as further development of BMW EfficientDynamics measures not only increase the power output and sporty driving characteristics, but also the efficiency and thus the range of BMW's first-ever SAV designed from the beginning to be fully electric.\n\nThe 2026 BMW iX is now offered in three variants. The new iX xDrive45 delivers 402 hp and an estimated range of up to 312 miles. The iX xDrive60 provides 536 hp and an expected range of up to 340 miles. And the performance-oriented iX M70 xDrive now further sets itself apart with unique M-specific design elements to go with up to 650 hp and expected 302 miles of range (estimated ranges according to preliminary BMW AG tests based on the EPA's test procedure standards).\n\nProduction of the 2026 BMW iX will begin in March of 2025 at BMW's Plant Dingolfing. Delveries are expected to commence in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nExterior design. Reduced design language, enhanced sportiness.\n\nThe revised exterior of the new BMW iX has an expressive presence and monolithic appearance with characteristic BMW SAV proportions, a design language reduced to the essentials, and clearly defined surfaces. The striking front design is characterized by the BMW grille with a redesigned frame and a new structure of vertical and diagonal lines in its interior. The updated grille can be ordered with illumination on the iX xDrive45 and iX xDrive60. Illumination is standard on iX M70 xDrive.\n\nThe headlights have also been redesigned with vertical elements for daytime running lights and turn indicators. The new structure of the BMW kidney grille is echoed in the diagonal lines of the headlight modules with available cornering lights.\n\nThe powerful rear end of the BMW iX underlines its modern look with generously proportioned surfaces divided by a few distinctive lines. The tailgate extends over the entire rear section without any breaks. The rear apron has been redesigned and features an integrated diffuser element in the new BMW iX M70 xDrive and in conjunction with the optional M Sport Package on other models.\n\nThe front and rear aprons of the new BMW iX have an almost seamless design and a higher proportion of surfaces painted body-color, giving them a sporty, elegant appearance as standard. The M Sport Package, now available as an option for the all-electric SAV for the first time, adds dynamic accents with powerful lines, distinctive air intakes, and new M alloy wheels.\n\nWhen specified with the optional M Sport Professional Package, the new BMW iX is fitted with dark M Shadowline headlights and rear lights. The new BMW iX M70 xDrive comes as standard with the design features of the M Sport and M Sport Professional Packages, and adds a model-specific BMW kidney grille with M logo, black exterior mirror caps, and exclusive 22-inch M alloy wheels. The 21- and 22-inch alloy wheels on the new BMW iX consist of 70% secondary aluminium.\n\nThe range of colors available for the new iX now includes five new finishes: Arctic Race Blue metallic, Dune Grey metallic, Carbon Black metallic, BMW Individual Frozen Deep Grey metallic, and Tanzanite Blue metallic (delayed release). The BMW Individual Exterior Line Titanium Bronze is also available as an option for iX xDrive45 and iX xDrive60.\n\nThe alloy wheels available for the new BMW iX feature an aerodynamically optimized design. 20-inch alloy wheels are standard on iX xDrive45 and xDrive60, while 21-inch or 22-inch M alloy wheels in four new variants are available as upgrades to the M Sport Package and the M Sport package Professional. The new BMW iX M70 xDrive underscores its position as the top performer in the range with exclusive 21-inch M alloy wheels as standard. 22-inch and, for the first time, 23-inch BMW Individual alloy wheels in a V-spoke design are now also available, either as a standalone option on iX M70 xDrive or as an enhancement to the M Sport Package on the other models. All the new wheel designs have aluminium inserts to help reduce drag.\n\nInterior: Progressive luxury, refined sportiness.\n\nThe interior ambience of the BMW iX, characterized by generous space and progressive luxury, can now be combined with the sporty design features of the M Sport Package. New M Multi-Function seats offer enhanced lateral support and a striking design. Available for the first time in the iX, these seats offer a wide range of adjustments, including backrest width adjustment and lumbar support, and pronounced contouring. The microfibre/Sensatec seats are finished in Atlas Grey/Black with M-specific stitching and accents in the BMW M tricolor. The new M multifunction seats are also optionally available in Amido natural leather and Castanea natural leather. As an option, they can also be combined with active seat ventilation. The M Multi-Function seats are part of the M Sport package on xDrive45 and xDrive60 and standard equipment for the new BMW iX M70 xDrive.\n\nThe M Sport package also includes an M leather steering wheel, two-tone instrument panel with M logo, Dark Silver trim finishers, anthracite headliner, M pedals, and high­gloss black trim on the center console.\n\nAppealing options: From the Climate Comfort Package to the Panoramic Eclipsing Roof and a tow hitch.\n\nThe Climate Comfort Package (optional on xDrive45 and xDrive60, standard on M70 xDrive) contributes to maximum well-being. Heated surfaces for the instrument panel and glove compartment, the door panels, center armrest and the rear seats ensure a comfortable temperature for all passengers. The Panoramic Eclipsing Roof, optional on xDrive45 and standard on the other models, enhances the bright and spacious interior with a one-piece viewing area that extends over both rows of seats. Instead of a roller blind, it features electrochromatic shading that can be activated at the touch of a button. The Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System, with 30 speakers and exciters in the front seats, delivers an exceptionally intense and precisely balanced sound experience. It is optional on xDrive45 and xDrive60, standard on M70 xDrive.\n\nA tow hitch will be available as an option for the new BMW iX in the summer of 2025. For all model variants, the maximum permitted towing capacity is 3,500 lbs.\n\nStrong performance from every drive system.\n\nIn each of the three model versions of the new BMW iX, a re-tuning of the drive system and optimized power electronics result in noticeably spirited power delivery. The new BMW iX xDrive45 delivers a maximum system output 402 hp, which enables a 0-60 time of just 4.9 seconds. The new BMW iX xDrive60 receives a 20 hp increase over the previous xDrive50 to 536 and accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in only 4.4 seconds. Both models have an electronically limited top speed of 124 mph.\n\nAt the very top of the iX line, the new BMW iX M70 xDrive offers genuinely exhilerating performance. The dual motors in the iX M70 xDrive combine to deliver a maximum system output of up to 650 hp in My Mode Sport - 40 more than its M60 xDrive predecessor - and a maximum torque of 811 lb-ft when Launch Control is activated. The new BMW iX M70 xDrive sprints from 0 to 60 mph in 3.6 seconds, on to an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph when equipped with performance tires.\n\nChassis technology and driver assistance systems. Continued development of BMW dynamics, comfort and safety.\n\nThe suspension technology of the BMW iX includes a double-wishbone front axle, a five-link rear axle, a stroke-dependent damper system, and electric steering with Servotronic function and variable ratio. The new BMW iX M70 xDrive also features adaptive two-axle air suspension with electronically controlled shock absorbers including M-specific tuning and M-specific anti-roll bars, Integral Active Steering, and M Sport brakes with red-painted brake callipers. Adaptive two-axle air suspension and Integral Active Steering are available as options for the iX xDrive45 and iX xDrive60 (as part of the Dynamic Handling Package), as are the M Sport brakes.\n\nIn the new iX, the suspension, damping and chassis control systems have been recalibrated to cope with the increased drive power and weight balance resulting from optimized battery technology. In addition, a hydraulic rear axle support bearing ensures a balance between sporty dynamics and ride comfort. Weight- and friction-optimized wheel bearings and tires with reduced rolling resistance also contribute to the increased efficiency of the new BMW iX.\n\nDrive and charging technology. More powerful and more efficient than ever.\n\nThe biggest single contribution to the increased efficiency of the new BMW iX comes from the first-ever use of silicon carbide semiconductor components (SiC inverters) in a BMW electric vehicle. The use of a SiC inverter now ensures significantly more efficient energy conversion in the drivetrain. Semiconductors made of silicon carbide are not only more efficient, but also more powerful and significantly more temperature-resistant than semiconductors made of conventional silicon.\n\nThis new inverter technology for the power electronics optimizes the power density of the drive system. This ensures high efficiency in the transfer of energy from the high-voltage battery to the electric motor. The innovative silicon carbide module of the inverter optimizes the peak performance of the electric motors, their efficiency, and thus the range of the new BMW iX. Thanks to the further development of the performance electronics and the fine-tuning of the wheel bearings and tires, among other refinements, the new iX xDrive60, for example, is expected to deliver about 10% more range than its predecessor - up to 340 miles when properly equipped (estimated range of up to 340 miles according to preliminary BMW AG tests based on the EPA's test procedure standards).\n\nLike the drive units, the high-voltage batteries used in the new BMW iX are based on the latest development of the fifth generation of BMW eDrive technology. The innovations also include a new battery management system that optimizes efficiency. Combined with the high energy density of the high-voltage batteries used in the new BMW iX, this contributes significantly to the outstanding range. A new battery cell technology gives the high-voltage battery in the BMW iX xDrive45 a net usable energy content of 100.1 kWh, while xDrive60 and M70 xDrive models have HV batteries with 113.4 kWh and 112.8 kWh of net usable energy respectively.\n\nAdaptive recuperation with efficiency-optimized control.\n\nWhen driving, the latest version of adaptive recuperation helps to extend range. The intelligent networking of the drive control system enables the intensity of energy recovery during acceleration and braking to be adapted to the traffic situation as determined by navigation data and the sensors of the driver assistance systems. For example, the recuperation power can be increased when approaching a junction and more energy can be fed into the high-voltage battery during deceleration.\n\nAs an alternative to adaptive recuperation, the driver can select high, medium, or low braking energy recovery for all traffic situations in the BMW iDrive menu. Low recuperation corresponds to the coasting function. The BMW iX simply glides along without drive torque as soon as the accelerator pedal is released. The electric drive is not energized and thus no energy is consumed from the high-voltage battery.\n\nIf required, My Mode EFFICIENT can be used to activate a highly energy-efficient operating mode. The MAX RANGE function can increase the range remaining before the next charging stop by up to 25% by limiting the drive power and maximum speed and reducing certain comfort functions.\n\nNew heat pump function, more efficient predictive heat management for the high-voltage battery.\n\nAll BMW iX models are equipped with an advanced heat pump function as standard. The new intelligent combination of heat pump technology ensures even greater efficiency in a wide range of driving situations and outside temperatures between -4° F and 86° F for the integrated heating and cooling circuit of the interior, as well as for the heating and cooling system of the drive system and high-voltage battery. For example, the waste heat from the electric motors can be directed to heat the interior and the high-voltage battery. This allows both the interior and the high-voltage battery to be heated simultaneously with the heat pump function and, if required, with a central electric auxiliary heater.\n\nWhen outside temperatures are low, a new storage heating function optimizes the pre-conditioning of the high-voltage battery for optimum DC charging with shorter charging times and greater efficiency. Efficient use of the heat generated by the instantaneous water heater allows the high-voltage battery to heat up much faster. Anticipatory thermal management ensures that the temperature of the high-voltage battery is optimally controlled in advance of a stop at a fast-charging station. When the navigation system is active, the battery is automatically pre-conditioned before a planned charging stop. Pre-conditioning of the battery can be manually activated and deactivated at any time. The high-voltage battery can also be pre-conditioned before departure via the My BMW App.\n\nCombined Charging Unit and optimized charging software.\n\nThe Combined Charging Unit (CCU) used in all model variants of the new BMW iX enables AC charging with a maximum output of 11 kW. The CCU of the new iX xDrive45 can charge at a rate of up to 175 kW at a DC fast charging station. The maximum charging power of the iX xDrive60 and iX M70 xDrive is 195 kW.\n\nPlug & Charge Multi Contract for maximum charging flexibility and convenience.\n\nThe new BMW iX offers the Plug & Charge Multi Contract function. Plug & Charge Mulit Contract makes charging at compatible public charging stations even more convenient, as digital authentication via an app or card is no longer required. When the iX is connected to the charging point, the necessary contract data for invoicing the energy costs is transmitted through a communication interface via the charging cable. Customers can digitally store up to five individual Plug & Charge-enabled power contracts from different providers in the vehicle.\n\nWide variety of systems for automated driving and parking.\n\nTo optimize comfort and safety, the new BMW iX offers a wide range of systems for automated driving and parking. These are based on BMW's latest modular technology kit and set new standards in terms of functionality, reliability, and availability. The advanced modular technology kit gives the new BMW iX outstanding intelligence in environmental monitoring and data processing. It also offers the potential for extensive integration of new and enhanced functions. These updates and enhancements can be installed over-the-air via remote software upgrades or downloaded from the BMW ConnectedDrive Store. This means that the BMW iX and its software remain conveniently at the cutting edge of technology.\n\nHighway Assistant for optimized comfort on long journeys.\n\nThe new BMW iX is already equipped with Driving Assistant Plus as standard. In addition to Forward Collision Mitigation, Active Blind Spot Detection and Lane Keeping Assistant and Speed Limit Assistant it also includes Distance Control and Steering Assistant, each of which can be used at speeds of up to 112 mph, as well as Active Speed Limit Assist.\n\nThe BMW Highway Assistant is the highlight of the range of options for automated driving. Its Level 2+ functionality allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel and comfortably position themselves on suitable limited access highways with divided lanes at speeds of up to 85 mph while keeping a close eye on the traffic. The system also includes Active Lane Change with eye activation. The combination of these two functions ensures outstanding driving comfort on long journeys with the new BMW iX.\n\nParking and maneuvering can be controlled by a smartphone.\n\nParking Assistant, including Back-Up Assistant, also comes as standard in the new BMW iX. The optional Parking Assistant Professional, part of the Driving Assistant Professional Package, adds Parking View including Top View, Panorama View and 3D View, as well as the BMW Drive Recorder and Anti-Theft Recorder.\n\nParking Assistant Professional also allows users to control parking maneuvers from outside the vehicle using a smartphone. The Maneuver Assistant can also automatically complete complex reversing maneuvers up to 650 feet in length.\n\nDisplay and operating system, connectivity. Intuitive user experience and advanced digital services.\n\nThe BMW iX is also a pioneer in the field of display and operating systems. It was the first production vehicle to be launched with the innovative BMW Curved Display. BMW iDrive with QuickSelect, based on the BMW Operating System 8.5, contributes to the advanced driving experience in the new BMW iX. With the BMW Curved Display and the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, it is geared towards operation via touch functions and natural speech.\n\nThe BMW Operating System 8.5 start screen permanently shows the map view of the navigation system or other individually configurable displays. On the driver's side, the screen displays vertical live widgets that can be selected with a swipe, and QuickSelect makes it easy to activate them without having to go to a submenu. Once the settings have been made, simply tap the Home symbol at the bottom of the display to return to the start screen. In addition to the Home symbol, there are now icons for direct access to the air conditioning menu, the All Apps menu, and Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™. In addition, the BMW iDrive in the new BMW iX provides the prerequisites for using digital services such as audio and video streaming as well as in-car gaming.\n\nThe BMW Live Cockpit Professional, optional on xDrive45 and xDrive60, standard on M70 xDrive, includes the BMW Head-Up Display and the Augmented View function on the Information and Control Display.\n\nWith the BMW Operating System 8.5, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant also gains additional capabilities, including in the areas of communication, navigation and vehicle control. It is also possible to integrate Amazon Alexa. The Alexa voice service can be used in the vehicle, for example, to make shopping lists using your voice, play music or control your smart home remotely.\n\nBMW Maps navigation system with charging-optimized route planning.\n\nThe BMW Maps cloud-based navigation system, which is part of BMW Live Cockpit Professional, offers even better functions for charging-optimized route planning on long journeys in the new BMW iX. This can be done either in the vehicle or via the My BMW App. Charging stops are planned in such a way as to arrive at the destination as quickly as possible. The driver's preferred charging status, with which he wants to reach the stopovers and the final destination, can also be set. On request, detailed information about the charging stations along the route can be accessed during the journey, such as availability, costs, and services in the vicinity.\n\nThe closer the vehicle gets to a scheduled charging stop, the more frequently the availability of the charging station is checked so that an alternative route can be determined in plenty of time if necessary. If the driver decides to make an individual charging stop along the way, the planning of the rest of the route is automatically adapted to the new conditions.\n\nOver-the-air updates: Remote Software Upgrade and BMW ConnectedDrive Upgrades.\n\nTo ensure that the new BMW iX always has the latest software, updates can be installed over the air. Remote software upgrades can include free quality or functional improvements.\n\nIn addition, customers can purchase further driver assistance, entertainment and personalization features through the BMW ConnectedDrive Store. Selected functions can be tested free of charge for a period of one month and then booked for a specific term or purchased outright.\n\nVideo streaming and in-car gaming on the control display.\n\nThe BMW Operating System 8.5 enables a wider range of digital content for information and entertainment, faster update cycles for functions, and optimized access to many specific online services. For video streaming on the Control Display, the Connected Package Professional offers YouTube as well as a video app for local channels. The entertainment offering includes both live channels and on-demand media libraries in the categories of news, sport, children's entertainment, movies, and series.\n\nThe latest generation of BMW iDrive also offers an innovative form of in-car gaming with the AirConsole platform. When the vehicle is stationary, the driver and passengers can play casual games alone or in multiplayer mode, for example to pass the time while the BMW iX's high-voltage battery is charging. Players only need their smartphone, which acts as a controller, and the BMW Curved Display. The selection of playable titles such as \"UNO Car Party!\", \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" or \"Starlit Kart\" is constantly being expanded.\n\nPersonalized user experience with BMW ID, My BMW App and personal eSIM, BMW Digital Key Plus as standard.\n\nThe standard equipment of the new BMW iX includes optimized smartphone integration via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto™, and 5G mobile phone reception as standard provides the ideal conditions for in-car gaming, audio and video streaming and the use of other online-based services.\n\nTo personalise the user experience with BMW ID, simply log in to the vehicle for the first time using a smartphone and scan the QR code. The personal profile is then added and synchronizable settings are loaded. This means that the customer is greeted on the vehicle display by name and, if desired, with a personal profile picture, and their individual vehicle settings are automatically loaded. In addition, the vehicle is added to the My BMW App without the customer having to do anything. As a universal digital interface, it provides information on the vehicle's status, available range and service and maintenance requirements at all times. It also provides remote access to functions such as locating the vehicle and locking and unlocking the doors.\n\nThe BMW Digital Key Plus can also be set up as standard for suitable smartphones and smartwatches with iOS or Android operating systems. Using the digital key on a mobile device, the new BMW iX automatically unlocks when approached. This is made possible by ultra-wideband (UWB) radio technology. The vehicle can also be started without taking the device out of a pocket or bag. This makes a conventional car key superfluous. The BMW Digital Key Plus is even easier to set up with the new Setup Card. Simply hold the card up to your smartphone or scan the QR code on the back. The BMW Digital Key Plus can be shared digitally with other people with individually definable rights and offers additional control functions via the My BMW App in the vicinity of the vehicle.\n\nDesigned for recycling: Moving towards a circular economy step by step.\n\nOne of the BMW's ambitious sustainability goals is to increase the use of secondary raw materials in vehicle production, as is already being implemented in many areas of the new BMW iX. The company is pursuing the vision of the circular economy, in which raw materials are kept in circulation for as long as possible and without any loss in quality in order to reduce the use of primary materials and the associated mining of new raw materials and their energy and CO intensive processing. BMW is also making important contributions to the recycling of vehicles at the end of their useful life.\n\nBMW's Recycling and Dismantling Centre (RDZ) develops technologies and solutions that are then made available to the entire recycling industry. For 30 years, the RDZ has been doing important groundwork to promote recycling in the automotive industry.\n\nParallel to the market preparation for the new BMW iX, BMW launched a Europe-wide partnership with SK tes, a leading provider of innovative technology life cycle solutions, in November 2024. In a special recycling process, cobalt, nickel and lithium are extracted from used batteries and then returned to the value chain for the production of new batteries.\n\nMore efficient driving with the efficiency trainer.\n\nIn addition to BMW EfficientDynamics technology, an efficient driving style is a key factor in reducing fuel consumption and CO emissions during the vehicle's service life. The efficiency trainer in the My BMW App provides drivers with tips on how to optimize their driving style in terms of sustainability. The digital assistant analyses previous journeys and provides tips for improvement as well as incentives by comparing fuel consumption with corresponding values from the BMW Community.\n\nBMW of North America, LLC was established 50 years ago to support the sales, marketing and distribution of BMW automobiles and motorcycles in the U.S. In 1993 BMW Group Financial Services NA, LLC was founded, and one year later BMW Manufacturing Co., LLC began assembling vehicles in South Carolina. In 2002 and 2003, BMW Group established MINI USA, and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars NA, LLC relaunching two iconic brands and rounding out its product portfolio.\n\nToday, the BMW Group has a nationwide corporate footprint in the U.S. which consists of nearly 30 locations in 12 different states. Beyond the National Sales Company and Financial Services headquarters in Woodcliff Lake, NJ, its manufacturing plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and numerous other operational facilities, BMW Group in the U.S. also includes Designworks, a strategic design consultancy in Santa Monica, CA, BMW Group Technology Office USA, a technology research and development center in Silicon Valley, and BMW i Ventures, a venture capital fund, also in Silicon Valley.\n\nBMW Group Plant Spartanburg is the largest single BMW production facility in the world, and the global center of competence for BMW Sports Activity Vehicles including the X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, and XM. The plant assembles more than 1,500 vehicles each day, and up to 450,000 annually. Since 1994, Plant Spartanburg has assembled nearly 7 million BMW vehicles in the U.S.\n\nThe BMW Group sales organization in the U.S. is represented through a network of 350 BMW retailers, 147 BMW motorcycle retailers, 104 MINI passenger car dealers, and 38 Rolls-Royce Motor Car dealers. The company's activities provide and support over 120,000 jobs across the U.S. and contribute more than 43.3 billion to the U.S. economy annually.\n\nJournalist note: Information about BMW Group and its products in the USA is available to journalists online at www.bmwusanews.com , www.miniusanews.com, and at www.press.bmwna.com",

        "title": "How Does Goal-Line Technology Work?",
        "body": "Goal-line technology has been an established feature of soccer's most prestigious leagues and tournaments for more than a decade.\n\nIts introduction met initial resistance from the game's rulers, but since it was implemented it has offered considerable assistance to officials around the world.\n\nSo, what is goal-line technology? How does it work? And what are the differences between goal-line technology and VAR? Read on to find out.\n\nWhat is Goal-Line Technology?\n\nGoal-line technology determines whether or not the ball has crossed the goal-line in a soccer game. It uses cameras and sophisticated electronic aids to tell the referee within a second via a wristwatch if a goal has been scored.\n\nSoccer is a relatively low-scoring sport, which makes goals super-important. Getting a decision wrong over whether or not the ball has crossed the goal-line can make a big difference to the outcome of a game.\n\nMost leagues use a system where up to seven cameras are trained on each goal from a variety of angles at that end of the soccer pitch.\n\nBetween them, they create an incredibly accurate picture of where the soccer ball is at any time.\n\nThis can pinpoint to within a millimeter exactly where the ball is - and whether or not it has crossed the goal-line.\n\nThe cost of implementing goal-line technology means that, while it is in use in leading tournaments like the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Champions League, and leagues like the EPL and the Bundesliga, it tends not to be present at less illustrious games.\n\nWhy Did Goal-Line Technology Begin?\n\nBy the early years of the 21st century, technological advances had allowed the introduction of scanning systems that made a big difference to several sports.\n\nTennis and cricket were among them, but soccer's rulers stood firm against the march of tech - until several high-profile incidents made its implementation inevitable.\n\nIn January 2005, Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll dropped a hopeful long shot by Tottenham's Pedro Mendes several feet behind the goal-line - but no goal was awarded and the game finished 0-0.\n\nAt the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, a shot from England's Frank Lampard hit the bar and bounced clearly behind the Germany line. No goal was awarded and the Germans won 4-1.\n\nThe latter incident was the tipping point for FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who instigated a series of tests on various tech systems.\n\nBy 2014, goal-line technology was in operation in the Premier League - and most, but not all, elite club and international competitions acted likewise.\n\nHow Does Goal-Line Technology Work?\n\nGoal-line technology works by tracking, precisely and definitively, the location of a soccer ball - specifically, to show whether or not the whole of the ball has crossed the line.\n\nIf even a fraction of the ball is not clearly behind the line, a goal should not be awarded.\n\nA vivid illustration of the impact of such a decision occurred in January 2019, as Liverpool were denied an equalizer at Manchester City by goal-line technology when virtually all - but not all - the ball was behind the line.\n\nCity won the game 2-1 - and went on to pip Liverpool to the EPL title by just one point.\n\nThe Hawk-Eye technology, the choice of most leagues that have adopted goal-line technology, uses six or seven cameras behind each goal to track the ball.\n\nBetween them they can produce a definitive visual image showing whether or not the ball has crossed the line.\n\nIf the ball has crossed the line and a goal should be awarded, the referee receives an electronic message to that effect within a second.\n\nCompetitions Using Goal-Line Technology\n\nWhile it can be argued that the simple yes-no verdict delivered by goal-line technology means it has been a success, not every top league or competition uses it.\n\nMajor League Soccer (MLS) is one league that has yet to implement goal-line technology. Another, surprisingly, is La Liga.\n\nIn both instances, the cost of making stadiums ready to use it has been cited as the reason for opting out.\n\nHowever, many other countries and international competitions do use the tech available.\n\nThere are more than 100 stadia that have been fitted with installations licensed by FIFA. Most use Hawk-Eye, while the others use Vieww, the other authorized provider.\n\nThe competitions where you will find goal-line technology in use include:\n\nYou can wager on many of the competitions that use goal-line technology at the best online sportsbooks, as well as the competitions that don't.\n\nArguments Against Goal-Line Technology\n\nDespite the widespread implementation of goal-line technology at the top levels of soccer across the world, there is some significant opposition to it.\n\nAmong the reasons why some fans, officials, and governing bodies do not approve are:\n\nIt Removes the Human Element\n\nSome observers feel that the occasional blunder by the officials in charge of a soccer match is simply part of the game.\n\nThe authority of the referee and his assistants should be paramount - even in situations when a controversial incident takes place on their watch.\n\nThis is not an easy position to maintain, given the speed and simplicity of decisions informed by goal-line technology.\n\nThe Cost\n\nThere is no escaping the fact that installing goal-line technology at a stadium is expensive.\n\nAnd, if a league decides to make this technological leap forward, all of its stadia need to be similarly upgraded.\n\nLa Liga is the only one of the top five European leagues that still does not use the tech; its president, Javier Tebas, is said to have balked at the $3.2 million ($3.2M) cost.\n\nIt's a similar story with MLS, where commissioner Don Garber said it would cost $260,000 to install goal-line technology in every ground.\n\nIt's Not Perfect\n\nDespite the high quality of technology used by Hawk-Eye and other providers, there have been rare occasions when the wrong decision has been made.\n\nOne example occurred in 2020, when Aston Villa goalkeeper Orjan Nyland carried the ball over his own line against Sheffield United.\n\nThe cameras' view was partially obscured and an image could not be created - which meant the goal that should have stood was not awarded.\n\nHow Goal-Line Technology Impacts Your Betting\n\nThe fact that you can be virtually certain of an accurate verdict when the ball is close to the line can help you when you are placing wagers at leading soccer betting sites or at retail sportsbooks.\n\nMany soccer betting markets relate to the number of goals scored in a game. They include the first goalscorer market, both teams to score, as well as the total recorded by both teams combined.\n\nWhen you are planning your soccer betting strategy, it can be reassuring to know that, with goal-line technology in place, you should not be on the receiving end of a shocking decision that dooms your wager to disaster.",

        "body": "Control Bionics is unlocking growth in sports science with technologies capturing neural and physiological data\n\nFrom the grass roots of backyards, parks and local clubs, to the high-octane action inside our many stadiums, sport is deeply ingrained in Australia's culture.\n\nAnd it's big business - both in Australia and internationally. A business in which sports science has made its mark, evolving from a niche academic field into a multi-billion-dollar industry driven by advances in tech, data analytics and an ever-growing demand for peak performance.\n\nOn the ASX, several companies, including the four listed below, are involved in the growing sports technology sector - from working to prevent and better treat concussion to improving athletic performance.\n\nThis neuroscience technology company is working to optimise brain health assessments for various conditions including alzheimer's and dazed athletes coming off the field with suspected concussion.\n\nCogstate's Cognigram Digital Cognitive Assessment System, previously known as CogSport, is used by physicians to detect changes in cognitive function in patients by measuring processing speed, attention, visual learning, working memory, visual motor function and executive function.\n\nThe Cognigram system can be used to assess cognition on a single occasion or cognitive change over periodic assessments.\n\nYou may have even seen or heard of Cognigram referred to as the Cogstate concussion test, and mentioned in coverage of footy games.\n\nBrad O'Connor told Stockhead that Cognigram is used by several leading sporting organisations in Australia and internationally including the Australian Football League (AFL) and National Rugby League (NRL).\n\n\"Whether you're measuring cognition after a traumatic brain injury or in the context of ageing, the critical aspect is being able to access scientifically valid, simple, low-cost tools, which Cogstate is committed to providing,\" he said.\n\nHitIQ is also focused on concussion management technologies. The company is targeting a growing worldwide concussion management market including elite and recreational sport, clinical practitioners, military, research, and combat sports.\n\nThe company said its platform aimed to provide a total concussion ecosystem supporting identification, monitoring and management.\n\nIts product suite uses high-end technology to span early detection, surveillance and assessment from concussion.\n\nHitIQ's tech is being used across a range of sports. The company has commercial agreements with the AFL, NRL and announced in November it had extended a deal with the English Premier League for 18 months.\n\nHitIQ said its technology would remain a core part of the Premier League's concussion management protocols, with head injury incidents securely recorded and administered through the company's centralised CSX concussion assessment technology platform.\n\nExecutive chairman Earl Eddings said the extension reinforced the trust the Premier League had in its concussion management technology.\n\n\"It is a clear acknowledgment of the positive impact our platform is having in supporting the league's commitment to player safety,\" he said.\n\nControl Bionics develops electromyography (EMG) based technology, including NeuroNode and NeuroStrip to empower individuals with severe disabilities.\n\nBut the company is also unlocking growth in other markets including health diagnostics and sports science with its technologies able to capture neural and physiological data.\n\nIn December Control Bionics announced it had acquired a 20% stake in US-based Neuro Elite Athletics, which is the company behind the NeuroBounce program for athletes.\n\nIts partial ownership in Neuro Elite Athletics will provide Control Bionics with an exclusive licensing arrangement for the NeuroBounce program in Australia and Japan.\n\nControl Bionics said the proprietary NeuroBounce was the only computerised EMG training program in the world, which had been proven to increase vertical leap by 5-15cm in just eight training sessions.\n\nIt has been used by US athletes for more than 25 years improving vertical jump height and explosiveness in sports such as basketball, volleyball and football.\n\nFor the NeuroBounce program, Control Bionics said its NeuroStrip technology was being leveraged to train the brain to activate previously unused muscle fibres.\n\nControl Bionics said Neuro Elite Athletics had significant US market potential with thousands of high school, college and professional sporting teams across major leagues.\n\nThe sports technology company describes itself as \"operating at the intersection of sports science and analytics\" with products designed to optimise performance, avoid injury and improve return to play.\n\nThe company creates smart technology that tracks and measures an athlete's movements in real-time, providing valuable insights into their physical condition, performance and health.\n\nThis data in turn helps coaches and teams make smarter decisions about training, tactics and recovery.\n\nCatapult's products include GPS tracking systems that measure things like speed, distance and effort, as well as video analysis tools that allow coaches to review key moments in games.\n\nCatapult said it supported more than 4,400 teams across 40 sports, spanning more than 100 countries. In 2024, the company launched a sideline video product called Focus Live for American Football.\n\nThe new product followed the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA ) - the governing body for US collegiate sports - approving sideline video analysis during American football games.\n\nIt also partnered with the UEFA to deliver live performance insights during Euro 2024.",

        "body": "Sports Technology Market by Technology (Wearable, AR/VR, Smart Stadium, Sports & Stadium Analytics, Sports Camera, Building Automation, Smart Equipment, Smart Clothing, Crowd Management), Solution (AI-based, Conventional) - Global Forecast to 2030\n\nThe sports technology market is projected to grow from USD 34.25 billion in 2025 and is projected to reach USD 68.70 billion by 2030; it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.9 % from 2025 to 2030. The driving factors for the sports technology market include increasing digitalization of sport and increasing demand for data-driven decision-making in professional as well as amateur sport.\n\nExpansion of wearable technology, including smart watches, fitness trackers, and performance monitoring devices, has led to a vast market segment focused on tracking sporting performance and health metrics. In addition, the combination of machine learning and artificial intelligence has revolutionized player analysis, training techniques, and injury prevention methods.\n\nVirtual reality and augmented reality technology have also revolutionized athlete training and the experience of fans. Growing popularity in esports has also spurred investment in gaming technology and streaming.\n\nDownload PDF Brochure @ www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdown...ogy-market\n\nBlockchain is a revolutionary technology for the sports sector that offers an open and secure platform to maximize many aspects of functioning. Its most important application is the area of fan engagement and loyalty schemes, where blockchain provides proof of transactions and digital ownership.This technology enables the development of tamper-proof, auditable records for ticketing systems to eliminate fraud and counterfeit tickets, and provide fans with a more secure buying experience.\n\nWith the emergence of blockchain-based digital collectibles like NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), sports associations now have the ability to sell exclusive digital content, from highlights to tokens. This not only generates new streams of revenue but also builds stronger relationships with fans, making them active contributors to the sports ecosystem.\n\nFor example, in August 2023, Identiv and collectID in there webinar in September 2023, discussed the future of fan engagement using phygital merchandise. The session brought out how NFC tags and blockchain technology are transforming the sports industry, providing teams with improved fan loyalty, customized experiences, and safe engagement through digitized products such as jerseys and scarves.\n\nThe Energy Management Systems segment in building automation in the sports technology market is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. An energy management system (EMS) is an essential platform that is geared towards monitoring, controlling, and optimizing the energy usage of buildings.\n\nThrough the use of data analytics and real-time monitoring, an EMS aids facilities in identifying patterns of energy consumption, indicating inefficiencies, and taking actions to minimize energy usage and costs. For smart stadiums, the incorporation of an EMS is at the heart of sustainability objectives and optimization of overall performance.\n\nThe systems allow stadiums to monitor energy usage in real-time, thus facilitating proactive intervention and maximum management of resources. Major market players for this sector include Johnson Controls, providing end-to-end energy solutions; Siemens, for end-to-end EMS solutions; and Schneider Electric, providing industries with energy management and automation solutions.\n\nSome of the most prominent ones are Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, LEED Platinum-certified due to its innovative energy management strategies, and London's Wembley Stadium, whose EMS is used to track energy consumption and optimize performance, helping the stadium's sustainability program significantly.\n\nThe formula one sport segment is expected to grow at a high CAGR during the forecast period in the sports technology market.

        "title": "Sebastian Coe: \"Sport needs a strategy that prioritises the audience\"",
        "body": "In a hotel in Paris last week, Sebastian Coe orders a cappuccino before sitting down with MARCA. He arrived on the eve of Lausanne, the Vatican of Olympism, where the IOC is the body that in March elects a president or, for the first time, a female president. The papal analogy is recurrent. In 131 years of Olympism there have been nine IOC presidents and 11 popes. He will have six rivals, although only Kirsty Coventry, the female candidate, and Juan Antonio Samaranch seem to count, in addition to the man who has climbed every rung imaginable in sport. Now he is aiming for the top.\n\nHe is 68 years old and still goes for a run every morning. \"When I do, my body notices it and as my children say, when I don't, they notice it.\" He wakes up almost every day in a different place. \"My schedule hasn't changed much from my daily routine at World Athletics. I still take pretty much the same flights every week,\" he says.\n\nIf you are elected president, what are the first three actions you will take in the first year?Answer: To give IOC members a very clear indication that I want them to be more involved in shaping the future and direction of the movement.\n\nThe second, of course, is that we have to prioritise sport. We have to recognise why the Olympic Games are unlike any other event on the planet. And we must not lose sight of that. It's about sport. About the extraordinary sacrifices that athletes make. We also have to recognise the value of athletes to become more our partners. And also, critically, the promotion and protection of women's sport. Absolutely non-negotiable.\n\nAre the Games in danger if the right decisions are not made?A: Any movement is in danger if the right decisions are not made. And for the Olympic Games and the Olympic Movement to have the future we want them to have, we have to act. Together and now.\n\nIn your speech to IOC members last week, you insisted a lot on the term togetherR: Absolutely key because all the changes and all the things that we have witnessed in World Athletics have not been achieved simply because I wanted to do it. I have worked with people and teams. I'm a good team builder and that's the only way you can function.\n\nMy candidacy is very simple. It's about making sure we understand the assets and the value that we have in the movement, that we protect them fiercely, that we drive growth opportunities. And we give athletes the ability to access their data, to access content, to use their assets and yes, to earn additional income off the field of play. And all those things we've already done at World Athletics. I can say that we've achieved gender balance on a council that now has 13 women and 13 men, and our revenue, for example, has increased by 25 per cent over the last four years.\n\nWe need to drive the conversion of sponsors into partners and we need to make sure that athletes are at the heart of all these decisions\n\nSebastian Coe\n\nIn the case of clarifying the situation of Trans athletes, the federation you preside over has surely been the one that has investigated the most. Do you think that it is the IOC who should legislate on this and not give arbitration to each federation?\n\nI'm a great believer in the primacy of international federations to make their own decisions. It's absolutely vital. But what the International Olympic Committee has to understand is that we rely on each other. So we have to establish a much greater collaboration between the national Olympic committees and the international federations. We also have to drive the conversion of sponsors into collaborative partners and we have to make sure that athletes are at the heart of all these decisions.\n\nEveryone has to have their autonomy, but at the same time, there is always an expectation of guidelines from the IOC to set that horizon. And often everything is left in the hands of the federations without any help or guidance.\n\nHow do you intend to defend the IOC from all the pressures that are generated by politics, such as the case of Russia?R: Well, the world is more complicated than it has ever been. It's not going to get any less complicated if I'm elected in March. We often see decisions about whether or not to include countries as political decisions, but that's not exactly the case. World Athletics has made decisions that are not about sporting power or politics, but about the integrity of the sport, whether it is about anti-doping systems or the ability of countries to field delegations in circumstances such as an invasion. All these things are about integrity. And that's why I think sometimes we shouldn't hide behind the risk of getting involved in politics. Those decisions were made about the integrity of our sport. And that, for me, is an inescapable principle.\n\nYou know a lot about political pressure, even as an athlete at those 1980 Games and Margaret Thatcher calling for a boycott that did not happen.R: I'm not going to take lectures from people about politics or sport. I've lived through it. I lived through the Commonwealth, the boycott of the Moscow Olympics. I was very outspoken about the position that the British government took on the boycott. And then, funnily enough, years later, I found myself serving in the same government that I was criticising.\n\nGreat Britain went to the Games. And I also went to the next one, which was also boycotted. I'm very familiar in that landscape. I've operated in international politics for many years with many roles both nationally and internationally.\n\nHow do you intend to ensure the legacy of all the host cities and that it is not a waste?\n\nI know from London 2012 that legacy is vital. And I'm very proud of the legacy that the London Games have left behind. Essentially, what we did was build a new city within an old city in the space of seven years, something that would not have happened if we had not had the Olympic Games.\n\nIn an unmovable timeframe, we had to build the Olympic Village, some venues, regenerate the land. We had to clean the soil, we had to dredge the rivers. We had to do all those things. The legacy now is profound. If we go back to the Olympic Park, it's not just facilities, it's an urban landscape, an urban community of 4,000 people, families living there, three universities, four or five major institutions, including art galleries, ballet and opera companies.\n\nWe achieved Europe's largest commercial development, a rapid transport system and 50,000 sustainable full-time jobs. So the most important thing to remember about legacy is to put it at the forefront and at the beginning of the process, because if you start to deal with legacy afterwards, you miss great opportunities to incorporate it into the final project. Because if you don't, it's likely that it won't happen or that it will be more expensive.\n\nIs he in favor of sharing the Games between several countries?\n\nNo, I think it's really important that, where possible, to be able to offer a Games to a central community, to a city. I know that Brisbane is going to have a more regional approach. But I think the experience for the athletes here is really important. The Olympic Village is unique. It brings together 10,500, 11,000 athletes from over 200 different countries with different beliefs, different ethnicities, different... And I really wouldn't want to lose the spirit. The spirit of an Olympic village. It's what sets us apart from the world championships.\n\nWith the arrival of emerging sports, is there a plan to permanently introduce new disciplines?\n\nI think it's important. The Olympic movement always wants to reach a younger, newer audience. To create links not only with fans, whether they are competitors, coaches, administrators or take on roles and responsibilities where they can advocate for and promote the sport. But it's absolutely critical that we make sure that those young people are at the heart of our thinking.\n\nI don't believe in sharing the Games between countries. The Olympic Village is unique, it is what distinguishes us from the world championships\n\nSebastian Coe\n\nAre you concerned about the tensions now surrounding the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)?\n\nWe have a very close relationship with WADA. It is the leading organisation for the protection of integrity around our anti-doping systems in sport. I certainly encourage governments to contribute more to this. And we work very closely with them in World Athletics through the Athletics Integrity Unit which was created by my reforms. So it is important that it is seen as an organisation that protects the integrity of sport and is supported by governments.\n\nThere is a recurring theme in the sense of the health of the athlete that is the mental. How can an association look after its own?A: Mental and physical well-being is absolutely vital. And protection systems, policies and procedures are needed. Athletics is very involved in this regard. But I would add here a third well-being, which is financial well-being, because I consider that the picture is broader than simple physical and mental well-being. Why? My instinct tells me that the physical presence in sport will be benefited because they often have the resources to stay in sport longer than they normally would, to be able to train and recover from injuries faster than they would. But also, the importance of mental well-being is motivated by avoiding being under unnecessary pressure because you are worried about whether you can afford to be in the sport, or if you have something to fall back on once your career is over.\n\nSo I consider them to be three inseparable parts of the same landscape. But it's really important that we do this, and we need to talk more to athletes about this. We need to really understand where all that pressure is. Is it educational? Is it global? How do we help them in that transition period from their careers to the rest of their lives? And that transition period should start towards the end of their career, or at most, three years after.\n\nDespite the universality of the Games, which is undeniable with the six billion people who followed the Paris Games around the world, is it necessary to revolutionize the way they are presented? There are sports that conduct interviews during the competition with the athletes themselves.R: I think the Olympic Games need to be permanently adapting. We do it in World Athletics. I know the presidents of the federations of other sports. They are always trying to see how they can make sports more accessible, both in terms of presentation in the stadium and also in the many platforms where young people are now consuming their sport. And that's critical.\n\nThe commercial landscape is not changing. It has changed. This is a world I have been working in for the last 30 years. I have a sports marketing business. It's one of my areas of expertise. We have to really change with that. We need digital-first strategies. We need an audience-first strategy, to really understand what our audience is telling us.\n\nOur fans tell us what they want, when they want it, where they want it. And we really have to recognise that the concept of sponsorship is a very outdated concept. Now, it's not just a transactional sponsorship. It's a collaborative partnership. And if you have really smart companies partnering with you, you have to take advantage of that. World-class companies tend to employ world-class people, and you need those world-class people to help you shape your strategy going forward.\n\nI think too often we see them as a marketing vehicle rather than a strategic partner. And that's something I think we can change. There are companies that I know want to engage in the Olympic movement in very clear and discrete spaces. Maybe the points of passion they share with us, maybe lifestyle products, maybe about women's sport... There are all sorts of things that I think we can create opportunities without harming your main partner. You can protect their rights. We did it in London 2012 very successfully. The best example I give you is that in World Athletics we have a clothing partner and a footwear partner, and that is important.\n\nShould athletes be paid at the Olympic Games?\n\nWe made that decision at World Athletics. But we did it in the name of world athletics. Athletics has some very big challenges and slightly different to other sports. Many of our best athletes, particularly on the other side of the Atlantic, end up in the NFL, basketball or are taken to baseball. When I go to a Caribbean Championship, I see a lot of agents recruiting kids for universities for baseball and basketball, just like I do for athletics.\n\nIt's a very specific challenge. We needed to professionalise the sport. We needed, as I've said, to really understand the financial well-being of athletes. So prize money for us has always been in place. In our World Championships next year in Budapest, we have a prize fund of $10 million to be spread across the Olympic movement. Of course, there is a wider debate, but as I said, interestingly in my speech last week I didn't talk at all about prize money.\n\nI talked about all the opportunities we can help athletes create for themselves, giving them their data, giving them their content and allowing them to drive their own revenue streams. And I think seeing this as prize money is what I'm really trying to say. There are other ways to do it.\n\nThis is the debate that should be had with the Association of National Olympic Committees. Many of them incentivise their athletes to win medals anyway. It's not an unusual concept, but I think I have to be clear here, it shouldn't be about financial burden. I would expect the international federations to take care of that and it's something that can be done when budgets are adjusted along those lines. My first pillar, which is to put sport first. And I think we have to make sure that the international federations get enough money to be able to invest in their sport, especially in innovation, so that their sports are more interesting and exciting for young people and also vitally important for the International Olympic Committee when it comes to selling its broadcasting rights.\n\nWe can help athletes create for themselves by giving them their data, giving them their content and allowing them to drive their own revenue streams\n\nSebastian Coe\n\nHow can Artificial Intelligence help sport?A: We talk a lot about AI and what it should be, but there's nothing new about it. We sound a bit old-fashioned when we start talking about cutting-edge technologies that have actually been around for a long time. The vice-chancellor of the university of which I am chancellor (Loughborough) wrote his doctoral thesis in 1985 on AI.\n\nLet's be clear. It's been around for a long time. We're talking about digital transformation. Every business I've been involved with was dealing with that process 10 years ago, probably more. So I think we need to stop talking about these technologies and implement them properly.\n\nHow can it help athletes?\n\nIt is clear that it can help them attract a younger audience to their sport. And that may be through the audience, which is the first really important focus. It can certainly help drive intelligence-led testing. At the moment, AI tends to be used to look at the efficiency of our testing programs and cost reduction. But it could actually really help as an accelerator of change and be more specific about identifying the athletes you think are most at risk.\n\nAnd actually, it can be a great driver of talent. Identifying location. It can really be a great help to smaller National Olympic Committees and smaller International Federations. Look, I come from one of the best sports universities in the world. That's part of, you know, where I work as well. And we have research students, new graduates, who are right now working on the ground in smaller National Olympic Committees, in smaller nations, and helping them identify their talent is just one of them.\n\nWe don't have to send 20 or 30 people for talent identification. This is a very different world and it can really help level the distance, close the gap between smaller federations and those with more resources.\n\nWe understand that at World Athletics you already know even in which parts of the stadium people experience it with more passion thanks to emotion bracelets and that can influence the price of tickets.R: We've been really understanding what our fans are telling us and what they want, what they think about our sport, how they consume it. We have enough intelligence, partly through AI, to know what's going on.\n\nWe know the viewing rhythm in a championship. We know some of the events where interest wanes and others where it peaks. And that critically helps us because it's not saying, 'well, that sport goes like that, so let's get rid of it'. It allows us to allocate resources to help that discipline. What you say is true: we can know in a stadium of a championship the emotional levels of the people watching the event depending on where they are sitting.\n\nWould you include Esports in the Games or should they have their own ecosystem?A: I've always seen esports as a recruitment tool. It's where a lot of young people spend a lot of time. But we really have to understand the nature of esports, because it's slightly different from gaming. Only a very small percentage of online games are sports-related, and that really depends on the publishers.\n\nWe, as sports people, have very little control over that. We prefer the virtual. So yes, we like to feel that there is technology that allows us to create a kind of physical activity within a virtual environment. And that's why we focus much more on virtual reality or virtual sport than on Esports per se. But of course there is a place for it.\n\nYou also have to understand some of the welfare issues that come with it, because there are welfare issues. I've been to the EA Sports World Championships with my kids. And you want to make sure you haven't entered that competition. You know, lots of energy drinks and all sorts of things to keep people going. So I think it can serve as a recruiter because it takes us to where young people are. But I think we have to be very clear that there are also some downsides. Nevertheless, I welcome the Olympic movement to Esports and applaud the IOC's criteria.\n\nIs there an ethical awareness to move sport away from countries that do not respect human rights when it comes to awarding the organisation of an event?R: This is the landscape we live in. I will always believe that very few sports have gone to a country in a championship or whatever format and left that country in a worse position physically, politically, culturally and socially. It's not always observable at first, but I think it can make a difference.\n\nAnd the only thing sport can do, and it can do it better than almost any other activity, is to highlight many of these issues. I have a lot of inflexible conversations with political leaders when we are looking to host our events, or they are looking to host our events. I want to know what their human rights record is; the working conditions in the stadiums being built; the supply chains; their procurement policies.\n\nI want to know your stance on modern slavery. All of these things are really important. And in the same way, they're going to ask me if my sport is well governed and if they're going to risk their reputation by going to a sport that isn't governed.\n\nSo this is the landscape that we live in, and we have to recognize that sport is a powerful tool for progress and that it can make a difference. And I tend not to see these organizations as that, kind of telling us, well, don't go to these countries for these reasons. I tend to see them as collaborators. I tell them: don't let us help you to convey some of those messages, but understand that we are a force for good.\n\nIf you want to globalize your sport and you don't want to be limited to the same three or four cities every time, then you're going to have to take it around the world. And you face challenges, including the climate\n\nSebastian Coe\n\nIs it possible to move the Games to other dates outside of the current ones for climatic reasons?R: I think it's clear that if you want to globalise your sport and you don't want to limit yourself to the same three or four cities every time, then you're going to have to take it all over the world. And you face challenges, including the climate.\n\nIf we had had the Olympic Games in Paris the year before, we would have had competitors in 46, 47 degrees temperature. The same in London, in Eugene, before the trials, American, of the World Championship in 2021, we had to reschedule the 5,000 and 10,000 of the USA Trials. Temperatures reached almost 40 degrees in Eugene, which is one of the coldest cities in the United States.\n\nSo this is not just going to be a stay in the comfort zone. We're going to have to do it because climate change is going to make it very difficult. You know, if I'm true to my word as an athlete. Is it fair to ask athletes to run world championship marathons in the middle of August? The answer is no. So we're going to have to look at it. Alternatively, we're going to have to properly review and coordinate the global calendar.\n\nAnd we also need, and this is very, very important, to understand how this fits into the sustainability and profitability of the Games. I've heard a lot of IOC members talk to me, and I've mentioned it before, about the possibility of mixing some of the summer sports with the winter sports, especially indoors. To relieve the pressure on cities and costs. In the winter games and certainly in the summer games.\n\nI think this is the moment. There is a choice. It's a time to think differently about many things. And that's the advantage of having a choice.\n\nAt the Paris Games, people complained about the price of some tickets. As a unique spectacle, do the Games have to be expensive?R: It's a very delicate and difficult balance. And I know that from London and 25%, approximately 25% of the budget, of an Olympic Games goes on the ticket. Sales. Athletics made a contribution of about $300 million to the organizing committee in Paris. And that's a good thing. But within that balance, you know, you're looking at ticket revenue to fund much of your project at an Olympic Games.\n\nBut all organising committees face the challenge of making tickets as socially affordable as possible, because we don't want families and local communities to be left out of the Games because of prohibitive prices. In London, 11 or 12 million people applied for tickets for the 100m final. That's not going to end happily for people. Although it is actually the general ambition, and it is not always easy. I absolutely respect that because you have to try to make tickets as socially affordable as possible. So that there are fans in the stadium and not just people with deep pockets.",

        "body": "STUTTGART, Germany, Jan. 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Hesai Technology HSAI, Outsight, and Embotech AG announce a strategic collaboration to deliver cutting-edge lidar technology and perception software for Embotech's AVM technology deployed in BMW facilities and known internally at BMW as Automated Driving In-Plant (AFW). This collaboration brings together industry leaders in autonomous driving solutions and sensing technology.\n\nEmbotech is the system provider for BMW's recently announced Automated Driving In-Plant series operation and global rollout. For the AVM solution, Outsight plays a key role with its advanced lidar software platform that tracks the ego-vehicle and the surrounding obstacles within BMW's production facilities, while Hesai supplies its industry-leading lidar sensors, renowned for their accuracy and reliability, which act as the \"eyes\" of the AVM system.\n\nThis AVM technology, initially implemented for the BMW 5 Series and 7 Series in Dingolfing, is now also in use for the MINI Countryman and other BMW models in Leipzig.

We look forward to continuing our collaboration and bringing this technology to more factories around the world.\"\n\n\"The combination of Outsight's sophisticated lidar software platform and Hesai's reliable lidar sensors perfectly complements Embotech's autonomous driving expertise,\" says Dr. Alexander Domahidi, CTO and Founder of Embotech. \"This collaboration ensures the highest standards of safety and efficiency in BMW's automated vehicle operations.\"\n\nAccording to Raul Bravo, President and co-founder at Outsight, \"Our collaboration with Embotech, Hesai, and BMW highlights the increasing maturity of LiDAR technology, particularly the software underpinning it. Its application to real-world factory conditions demonstrates its ability to enhance industrial safety and efficiency, while underlining the importance of a comprehensive framework to realise the potential of autonomous driving.\"\n\nThe integrated solution is now actively supporting the marshalling of newly manufactured vehicles through various stages of the production and logistics process in three BMW facilities. This deployment marks the initial phase in a global rollout to multiple plants across Europe and North America.\n\nThis collaboration represents a significant step forward in industrial automation. It combines Embotech's proven autonomous driving capabilities with best-in-class perception technology from Outsight and Hesai.\n\nAbout Hesai\n\nHesai Technology HSAI is the global leader in lidar technology for automotive and robotics applications.

        "body": "Typography is more than just arranging letters -- it's a powerful tool for communication, emotion, and identity. In the world of sports, typography plays a crucial role in shaping brand identities, creating dynamic visuals, and capturing the energy and passion of athletic competition. Sport typography is a specialized field that combines design, culture, and movement to create impactful visuals that resonate with fans and athletes alike.\n\nThis article dives deep into the world of sport typography, exploring its history, key elements, design principles, and its role in modern sports branding. Whether you're a designer, marketer, or sports enthusiast, this guide will give you a comprehensive understanding of how typography fuels the visual language of sports.\n\nWhat is Sport Typography?\n\nSport typography refers to the use of typefaces, lettering, and design elements to create visuals that embody the spirit of sports. It's used in logos, jerseys, posters, advertisements, and digital media to convey energy, strength, speed, and teamwork. Sport typography is not just about aesthetics -- it's about creating an emotional connection with the audience and reinforcing the identity of a team, league, or event.\n\nFrom the bold, blocky letters of the NBA to the sleek, modern fonts of the Olympics, sport typography is everywhere. It's a key component of sports branding, helping to differentiate teams, evoke emotions, and build loyalty among fans.\n\nThe History of Sport Typography\n\nThe evolution of sport typography mirrors the growth of sports as a global phenomenon. Here's a brief look at its history:\n\n1. Early Days (Late 19th to Early 20th Century)\n\n2. Mid-20th Century\n\n3. Late 20th Century to Present\n\nKey Elements of Sport Typography\n\nSport typography is defined by several key elements that set it apart from other forms of typography:\n\n1. Bold and Dynamic Fonts\n\nSport typography often features thick, heavy fonts that convey strength and power. These fonts are designed to stand out, whether on a jersey, a billboard, or a digital screen.\n\n2. Custom Lettering\n\nMany sports brands use custom-designed fonts to create a unique identity. For example, the NBA's typography is instantly recognizable and cannot be replicated by standard fonts.\n\n3. Energetic Layouts\n\nSport typography often incorporates dynamic layouts, such as slanted text, overlapping letters, or asymmetrical designs. These layouts mimic the movement and energy of sports.\n\n4. Color Psychology\n\nColors play a crucial role in sport typography. Bold, contrasting colors like red, blue, and yellow are commonly used to evoke excitement and passion.\n\n5. Cultural Influences\n\nSport typography often reflects the culture and history of a team or event. For example, the typography of the Olympics incorporates elements from the host country's culture.\n\nDesign Principles of Sport Typography\n\nCreating effective sport typography requires a deep understanding of design principles. Here are some key considerations:\n\n1. Legibility\n\nEven the most dynamic typography must be easy to read. This is especially important for jerseys and scoreboards, where clarity is essential.\n\n2. Consistency\n\nSport typography should be consistent across all platforms, from print to digital media. This helps to reinforce brand identity and build recognition.\n\n3. Emotion\n\nTypography should evoke the emotions associated with sports, such as excitement, determination, and teamwork. This can be achieved through the choice of font, color, and layout.\n\n4. Adaptability\n\nSport typography must work in a variety of contexts, from large banners to small mobile screens. Designers need to ensure that their typography is scalable and versatile.\n\n5. Innovation\n\nThe best sport typography pushes boundaries and sets trends. Designers should experiment with new techniques and technologies to create fresh and exciting visuals.\n\nThe Role of Sport Typography in Branding\n\nSport typography is a cornerstone of sports branding. Here's how it contributes to building a strong brand identity:\n\n1. Creating Recognition\n\nDistinctive typography helps fans instantly recognize their favorite teams or events. For example, the bold, italicized font of the NFL is synonymous with American football.\n\n2. Building Loyalty\n\nTypography that resonates with fans can foster a sense of belonging and loyalty. This is especially important for teams with a strong fan culture.\n\n3. Conveying Values\n\nThe style of typography can communicate the values of a team or event. For example, sleek, modern fonts may convey innovation, while classic serif fonts may evoke tradition and history.\n\n4. Enhancing Merchandise\n\nTypography is a key element of sports merchandise, from jerseys to caps. Well-designed typography can make merchandise more appealing and marketable.\n\nThe NBA's typography is bold, dynamic, and instantly recognizable. The red-and-blue logo, with its slanted lettering, embodies the energy and excitement of basketball.\n\n2. FIFA World Cup\n\nEach FIFA World Cup features custom typography that reflects the culture of the host country. The 2022 Qatar World Cup typography, for example, incorporated Arabic calligraphy.\n\n3. Olympics\n\nThe Olympics use sleek, modern typography to convey unity and global participation. The typography often includes elements from the host country's culture.\n\n4. Esports\n\nEsports teams use bold, futuristic fonts to appeal to a younger, tech-savvy audience. The typography often features sharp angles and vibrant colors.\n\nThe Future of Sport Typography\n\nAs technology evolves, so does sport typography. Here are some trends to watch:\n\n1. 3D Typography\n\nAdvances in 3D design software are enabling designers to create more immersive and dynamic typography.\n\n2. Motion Typography\n\nWith the rise of digital media, motion typography is becoming increasingly popular. Animated fonts can add an extra layer of energy and excitement.\n\n3. Personalization\n\nFans are increasingly seeking personalized experiences. Customizable typography, such as jerseys with fan names, is becoming more common.\n\n4. Sustainability\n\nAs sustainability becomes a priority, designers are exploring eco-friendly materials and techniques for sport typography.\n\nConclusion\n\nTypography is more than just design -- it's a language that captures the essence of athletic competition. From the bold, dynamic fonts of the NBA to the sleek, modern typography of the Olympics, sport typography plays a vital role in shaping the visual identity of sports.\n\nAs technology and design continue to evolve, the possibilities for typography are endless. Whether you're a designer, marketer, or sports fan, understanding the art and science of sport typography can help you create visuals that inspire, excite, and connect.",

        "body": "Parions Sport, a prominent name in France's sports betting industry, has established itself as a market leader with a robust presence across both retail and online platforms. Owned and operated by Française des Jeux (FDJ), the largest gambling operator in France, Parions Sport leverages strategic innovations, a wide range of offerings, and effective marketing to stay competitive. With increased adoption of digital sports betting, Parions Sport continues to capture new demographics and expand its footprint, particularly in regulated markets. This article explores its history, operations, strategies, and future outlook.\n\nParions Sport's origins are rooted in the founding of Française des Jeux (FDJ), a state-backed operator established in 1933 to oversee lottery and betting services in France. The sports betting division was launched under the Parions Sport brand to cater to growing demand for legal and regulated sports wagering.\n\nFDJ transitioned from being a fully state-owned entity to a publicly traded company following an IPO in 2019. However, the French government retains a 20% stake in the company, ensuring oversight over responsible gambling practices and compliance.\n\nThe executive leadership at FDJ, including CEO Stéphane Pallez, has been instrumental in modernizing Parions Sport's operations, with a strong focus on digital transformation and customer engagement.\n\nFrançaise des Jeux enjoys a strong financial position, backed by both private investors and state support. The company's IPO raised over €1.9 billion, enabling it to invest in digital technology, marketing, and product development. FDJ has also allocated a significant portion of its resources toward Parions Sport, reflecting the growing importance of sports betting in its revenue stream.\n\nAs of FY2024, FDJ's sports betting revenues have been rising steadily, driven by a combination of online growth and expanded retail networks. The company frequently reports strong financial health, which allows continuous innovation in the betting segment.\n\nParions Sport operates primarily in the French market, where it holds a dominant share of the regulated betting industry. However, FDJ has been exploring international expansion opportunities through partnerships and licensing agreements. Its strategic focus has been on regions with robust legal frameworks for gambling, particularly across Europe.\n\nAlthough Parions Sport does not directly compete in markets such as the U.S. and Asia, FDJ has shown interest in collaborating with foreign operators to gain market insights and diversify its offerings.\n\nParions Sport employs a multi-channel marketing strategy that integrates traditional and digital advertising. Sponsorships of high-profile sports events, teams, and leagues play a key role in enhancing brand visibility. For example, Parions Sport has partnerships with Ligue 1 football clubs and other major sporting organizations in France.\n\nThe company has invested heavily in social media marketing, influencer partnerships, and promotional campaigns to attract younger bettors. Additionally, Parions Sport frequently runs special offers, such as boosted odds and cashback promotions, to increase customer retention and engagement.\n\nAdvertising spend remains a crucial part of Parions Sport's strategy, although it is balanced by strict adherence to France's gambling regulations, which limit certain types of promotions to prevent gambling addiction.\n\nParions Sport stands out for its technology-driven innovations, particularly in online betting. The platform offers a seamless user experience across mobile and desktop, with features such as in-play betting, live streaming, and personalized recommendations.\n\nIn recent years, Parions Sport has integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to enhance its risk management and odds-setting algorithms. The company also prioritizes responsible gambling by offering tools that allow users to set deposit limits, self-exclude, and access support services.\n\nOne of the key USPs is the availability of betting options tailored to local sports fans, with a focus on football, basketball, and tennis -- the most popular sports in France. Parions Sport also differentiates itself through its loyalty programs and gamified betting experiences.\n\nIn the competitive landscape, Parions Sport faces rivals such as Betclic, Unibet, and Winamax. Despite strong competition, Parions Sport benefits from its association with FDJ, which provides unparalleled brand recognition and trust among French consumers.\n\nParions Sport's dual presence in retail and online betting gives it a strategic edge. While digital competitors primarily focus on online offerings, Parions Sport leverages its extensive network of retail outlets to reach a broader demographic, including older and less tech-savvy bettors.\n\nMoreover, the platform's focus on localized sports events and its compliance with French regulations have solidified its position as a market leader.\n\nThe legal environment for gambling in France is tightly regulated, with oversight provided by the French National Gaming Authority (ANJ). Parions Sport operates under a license from the ANJ, which mandates strict compliance with anti-addiction measures, advertising restrictions, and fair gaming practices.\n\nRecent legislative changes have introduced more stringent rules regarding the promotion of sports betting, requiring operators to adopt socially responsible advertising. Parions Sport has proactively adjusted its marketing campaigns to align with these new regulations while maintaining brand visibility.\n\nAdditionally, FDJ's public ownership structure ensures greater transparency and accountability, reinforcing consumer trust in Parions Sport's operations.\n\nParions Sport is poised for continued growth, driven by increasing adoption of online betting and investments in technology. The platform aims to expand its market share by introducing new betting products, enhancing its live betting capabilities, and improving user engagement through personalized content.\n\nFDJ's strategic priorities include leveraging data analytics to optimize customer experience and exploring opportunities for international expansion. As infrastructure for major sporting events -- such as the 2024 Paris Olympics -- develops, Parions Sport is expected to benefit from heightened betting activity.\n\nLong-term growth will also depend on the platform's ability to adapt to evolving regulatory frameworks and maintain its commitment to responsible gambling.",

        "title": "Ultimate hybrid guide: every petrol-electric car and SUV in",
        "body": "Electrified vehicles are a hot topic in New Zealand, thanks to rising fuel prices, increasing climate change awareness and a Government Clean Car Importer Standard that still requires distributors to bring in lots of electrified vehicles.\n\nDRIVEN Car Guide is here to help, with a complete guide to every electrified vehicle on sale in NZ, arranged from lowest to highest price.\n\nA hybrid (or HEV) blends a combustion engine with a small battery pack and electric motor. It has the ability to drive on electric power alone, but usually only for very short distances: from a few hundred metres to a couple of kilometres. The rest of the time the battery/motor assists the combustion engine.\n\nNote that you don't plug in a hybrid/HEV. The battery is recharged by energy recovered from braking and deceleration, or sometimes from the combustion engine when driving conditions are suitable.\n\nYou don't plug in a HEV. The battery is recharged by energy recovered from braking and deceleration, and sometimes by the engine.\n\nOur guide doesn't include \"mild hybrid\" (MHEV) vehicles, which have a similar ability to recover and store energy to reduce fuel consumption, but don't generally have the ability to drive on electric power alone.\n\nMG3 HYBRID+\n\nThe new MG3 is officially NZ's cheapest full hybrid. And with an impressively comprehensive hybrid system at that: with a relatively large 1.83kW battery it puts a lot of emphasis on electric driving, with help from the petrol engine either as a range extender or to drive the wheels.\n\nThe lineup opens with the Excite; the range-topping Essence adds a 360-degree camera, LED lights, keyless entry and MG's iSmart mobile app.\n\nToyota's supermini-sized Yaris made several generational leaps when the latest model was launched in 2020, with a completely new platform lots of new technology and the additional of a hybrid powertrain option for the first time in NZ (although petrol-electric versions of previous models have appeared on the used-import market).\n\nThe hybrid matches a three-cylinder petrol engine with a lithium-ion battery pack, resulting in truly outstanding fuel economy figures. Toyota offers the hybrid in both entry GX and more luxurious ZR trims.\n\nThe ZS compact-city is best known as a pure-electric model, but in this new-generation model MG has introduced its Hybrid+ petrol-electric technology.\n\nAvailable in Excite and Essence models to align with other MG models, the Hybrid+ has an outwardly complicated \"hybrid transmission\" that ultimately is very easy to drive.\n\nToyota NZ's Corolla hybrid is now in its second generation. Launched in the previous model in 2016, the petrol-electric powertrain was improved and the model range expanded for the latest version from 2018: a bit less power, but better efficiency.\n\nThere's now a three-tier Corolla hybrid lineup, from the GX to the SX to the top-of-the-line ZR (and you can even get extra-fancy with a two-tone model). The hatch remains the core body shape, but you can also have a wagon.\n\nHonda's e:HEV technology now dominates the revised range. The ICE-only entry-level Life version has been dropped, leaving the SUV-like Crosstar as the only pure-petrol model. A more powerful hybrid powertrain now features in the flagship Luxe - now called Luxe Sport - and a new model, the RS. There's even a dressed-up RS Mugen version.\n\nYou don't plug e:HEV in, so it's not technically an EV. But nor does the petrol engine drive the wheels like most other hybrids. Instead, it mostly acts as a generator to either feed power to the battery pack and/or drive the electric motor, which then drives the wheels.\n\nThe Jolion was the first of a new generation of globally focused models from Haval, Great Wall Motors' SUV brand, when it was launched in 2020. A hybrid powertrain option is a more recent addition, pairing a 1.5-litre petrol engine to a battery and single electric motor combo. The transmission is a dedicated two-speed unit.\n\nThe refreshed-for-2024 Jolion HEV comes in Premium, Lux or flagship Ultra specifications. The hybrid is now significantly upgraded over the standard petrol Jolion well beyond the powertrain, with different styling and multi-link rear suspension instead of the torsion beam.\n\nA larger and slightly newer sibling to the Haval Jolion compact-SUV, the H6 moves the technology and quality game even further on for China's GWM. The H6 is aimed right at the medium-SUV heartland of the Kiwi car market.\n\nThe H6 HEV carries over the hybrid powertrain from Jolion, but like its smaller stablemate there's a choice of specification: the new entry Lux or the top Ultra.\n\nOstensibly, the Yaris Cross hybrid is simply an SUV version of the Yaris hatch, with higher ground clearance. Same basic powertrain and platform.\n\nBut you can also think of the Cross as a completely different model: larger, more practical and with bespoke styling to set it apart.\n\nPrice $38,990-$46,390 Powertrain 1.5-litre petrol three-cylinder engine with hybrid electric system, CVT, FWD Power/torque 85kW (combined)/120Nm Consumption 3.8l/100km\n\nRead DRIVEN's review of the Toyota Yaris Cross hybrid\n\nTOYOTA COROLLA CROSS\n\nIt's arguably the biggest conceptual change for the ubiquitous Corolla in its long, long history: the addition of the Cross to the family means the most famous small-car in the world is now available as a crossover-SUV. It fits neatly in-between the C-HR and RAV4.\n\nThe Cross comes with a 2.0-litre petrol-electric hybrid powertrain making 135kW combined, with either front drive or Toyota's clever E-Four AWD - albeit only as an option on the flagship Limited.\n\nKia's electrified-only compact SUV comes in BEV, PHEV or hybrid models. The latter makes a strong case in terms of sheer value for money, with prices starting at just over $40k and four different models to choose from: Light, Earth, Water and GT-Line.\n\nAs with sister brand Hyundai, the petrol-electric powertrain gets a boost in terms of driver-appeal by employing a six-speed dual-clutch transmission.\n\nAfter two years away form the NZ market, the HR-V compact-SUV is back in all-new form, using the same e:HEV hybrid technology as the larger ZR-V and CR-V models.\n\nThe HR-V is available in just one model for now: the Sport, with a 1.5-litre engine (same as Jazz, smaller than ZR-V and CR-V). Also like Jazz, the HR-V features Honda's clever Magic Seat configuration, giving it one-up on its larger SUV siblings.\n\nThe facelifted 208 GT arrives in NZ solely in hybrid form, with a 48-volt power system and electric motor integrated into the transmission. Power and torque are almost identical to the previous ICE version, fuel consumption has been reduced by 1.4l/100km.\n\nYou can spot the new 208 by its extra LED \"claws\" in the front bumper. The hybrid also picks up the body-colour grille previously only offer on the pure-electric model.\n\nThe C-HR was always intended to add some wow-factor to Toyota's mainstream SUV lineup, but the all-new model has also stepped up significantly in design and technology.\n\nThe mainstream models have a 1.8-litre engine and FWD, but the new GR Sport boasts a larger-capacity 2.0-litre engine with Toyota's E-Four AWD.\n\nHow times change. Once upon a time, the Camry sedan was the default Toyota family-car choice, but in these days of SUVs it's almost a niche model.\n\nThe facelift model has adopted a more contemporary (some might say wacky) look, and is still available in a comprehensive lineup of GX, SX and ZR specifications.\n\nWhat used to be the XV is now the Crosstrek. But there's more than just a new badge: this is a proper model change, with freshened styling inside and out - including more aggressive crossover cladding and an 11.6in portrait touch screen.\n\nThe e-Boxer powertrain is an undeniably mild application of electrification to Subaru's compact crossover/SUV. But the \"motor assist\" system makes it a full hybrid nonetheless and while it only offers small fuel-economy gains over the standard Crosstrek (0.7l/100km), we reckon it makes for a better drive.\n\nRAV4 sales are now purely hybrid for NZ. It's frugal and the E-Four AWD system is clever, too, with the rear axle powered only by the battery, giving precise control.\n\nThere are five separate variants, ranging from the entry GX to the lifestyle-oriented Adventure.\n\nPeugeot is spreading its sweet 3-cylinder hybrid powertrain as far and wide as it can. While the 2008 compact-SUV is still available in pure-petrol form (unlike its 208 or 3008 siblings), you can also now have it with petrol-electric power.\n\nIt comes only in top GT specification, for an extra $5k over the equivalent ICE version.\n\nA quiet achiever in the sales charts for decades, the Qashqai is something of a crossover pioneer: one of the first SUV-style family cars to be available in front-drive only, making it very much an on-road car only.\n\nThe latest generation also serves up Nissan's clever e-Power hybrid technology, with the electric motor driving the wheels most of the time and the petrol engine used mainly as a generator. The e-Power powertrain comes only in the higher-specification grades, Ti and Ti-L.\n\nThere's still a wait for the pure-electric version of Hyundai's all-new Kona, but the full range of petrol-electric hybrids is here right now.\n\nAs with the previous model, the new Kona Hybrid is based around a 1.6-litre direct-injection petrol engine with 1.32kWh battery and electric motor. You can have it in everything from a base Active to dressed-up N Line specification.\n\nFollowing the Escape plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), comes a conventional hybrid version of its medium-sized SUV - which the company calls an FHEV, meaning \"full hybrid\", a way of distinguishing this tech from the growing number of mild hybrid (MHEV) models it offers.\n\nThe facelifted Escape hybrid comprises two models, the new Titanium FWD and the flagship ST-Line X AWD. Both are powered by the familiar 2.5-litre petrol engine, paired with a lithium battery and electric motor(s).\n\nThe Forester e-Boxer employs the same hybrid powertrain as the smaller XV, with a 2.0-litre petrol engine and modest electric motor. That means a bit of step down from the standard Forester models in terms of engine capacity (they are 2.5 litres) and performance, for a modest nine per cent gain in overall fuel economy. Bu the hybrid tech makes more of an impact in urban driving, with a 19 per cent fuel economy improvement.\n\nSubaru has spread the e-Boxer powertrain over two models: an entry version called Sport and the top Premium, which comes fully loaded in line with the rest of the Forester range.\n\nPrice $52,490-$56,990 Powertrain 2.0-litre petrol engine with hybrid electric system, CVT, AWD Power/torque 110kW/196Nm (petrol), 12kW/66Nm (electric) Consumption 6.7l/100km\n\nRead DRIVEN's review of the Subaru Forester e-Boxer\n\nKIA SPORTAGE\n\nKia's refined new Sportage hybrid matches a 1.6-litre engine to a smooth electric motor, giving the Korean brand a genuine rival for the market-leading Toyota RAV4.\n\nIt's FWD only, but the provision of a conventional 6-speed automatic transmission (rather than the more hybrid-conventional CVT) is a draw for those who enjoy a more engaging driving experience.\n\nHonda's new hybrid SUV fits neatly in between the HR-V and CR-V and borrows much of its powertrain technology from the Jazz e:HEV - but with a larger-capacity 2.0-litre petrol engine providing the power for the (mostly) electric drive.\n\nThe Sport e:HEV is the flagship of a range that also includes the Turbo ICE model. Expect to see the 2.0-litre e:HEV powertrain in an all-new CR-V in 2023, and potentially the Civic some time next year.\n\nPut a Suzuki Jimny and Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen into a bottle, shake them up and you might get the GWM Tank 300 (from the same company that produces Haval crossover SUVs).\n\nTank is a hard-core 4x4 with retro-inspired looks. And it's one of the few such vehicles to be available with a petrol-electric hybrid powertrain.\n\nAvant garde style is a long-standing Peugeot 3008 tradition, and this all-new model pushes it even further forward, with a striking exterior and stunning interior design concept.\n\nFor NZ, the new-gen coupe-SUV is now hybrid-only, with the now-ubiquitous 1.2-litre 3-cylinder engine and electrified hardware. Peugeot calls it a \"mild\" hybrid, but it contains an electric motor in the transmission, so we reckon it's the real-deal.\n\nLexus is now in the baby-SUV business. Not so hard for the luxury brand, given it has a full range of Toyota technology to draw on.\n\nThe cute-looking LBX (that's \"Lexus breakthrough crossover\" if you were wondering) owes a lot to the Toyota Yaris Cross underneath, including its fizzy three-cylinder engine, although it's distinctively Lexus on top. The entry specification is FWD only, but the top two also bring the option of AWD,\n\nThe facelift version of Honda's 11th-generation Civic hatchback has switched to hybrid power only - and a more luxury oriented specification, including full leather upholstery and an integrated Google Assistant.\n\nHonda's proprietary e:HEV powertrain is similar to that used in the CR-V, running as a range-extender much of the time and using the petrol engine as a generator to make electricity.\n\nThe new Hyundai Tucson Series II has been launched as a hybrid-only model in NZ - at least for the time being, as Active, Elite, Limited and N Line models. There are minor styling updates on the outside and a brand new interior.\n\nThe other big change is size. Where the previous Tucson hybrid was a short wheelbase model (smaller than the rest of the Tucson range), the new one has stepped up to full-length.\n\nAlfa Romeo calls its new Tonale a \"mild hybrid\" and yes, the battery is tiny: 0.8kW. But it does indeed have a small electric motor that can can propel the vehicle for short distances when the petrol engine is off, so we're going to call it a hybrid and be be happy with that.\n\nTonale is a compact SUV that boasts what Alfa says is \"diesel-like\" fuel economy. It certainly looks the part and comes in two models, the Ti and Veloce. It represents a whole new generation of electrified models from the Italian brand, including a PHEV to come for NZ.\n\nConventional petrol powertrains continue in the mainstream fourth-generation X-Trail, but for the range-topping models e-Power technology takes over.\n\nThere's a small-capacity petrol engine under the bonnet, but it never drives the wheels; instead, it generates power to charge the battery, which then drives the wheels via electric motors. The e-Power system is not new to Nissan, but the related e-4orce AWD is. Because it's fully electric, it reacts 10,000 faster than mechanical AWD and allows precise control of each wheel.\n\nPrice $59,990-$64,990 Powertrain 1.5-litre turbo-petrol three-cylinder generator with hybrid electric system and dual electric motors, single speed, AWD Power 157kW (electric motors combined) Consumption 6.1l/100km\n\nRead DRIVEN's review of the Nissan X-Trail e-Power e-4orce\n\nLEXUS UX 250h\n\nThe UX compact SUV has just been launched with BEV power, but the mainstay models to date have been the 2.0-litre petrol-electric hybrids, which continue in the current range.\n\nThere's no shortage of choice: you can have your UX with FWD or AWD, in entry, luxury Limited or slightly edgier-looking F Sport trim.\n\nKia's seven-seat Sorento is somewhat unique in the mainstream market by offering nearly every powertrain under the sun: petrol, diesel, PHEV and this petrol-electric hybrid, in either 2WD or AWD configurations.\n\nThe battery tech is right up there (lithium-ion) and the AWD models even retain good off-tarmac ability, with Terrain Mode Select and a 50/50 lock for slippery surfaces.\n\nHonda's all-new CR-V has adopted the e:HEV technology already seen in the smaller ZR-V - albeit only in the flagship RS model, which features a sportier look, firmer suspension and more equipment.\n\nSo the price has taken it more upmarket, but there's plenty in the car that feels pretty premium. And the complex e:HEV hybrid technology under the bonnet is really effective... and really simple for the driver.\n\nThe Highlander seven-seat SUV has long been a family and fleet favourite in NZ, but it's taken until the latest generation (launched 2021) for a hybrid powertrain to become available to new-vehicle buyers.\n\nBut it's been achieved in fine style, with essentially the same powertrain as the smaller RAV4 giving the Highlander an excellent blend of performance (it has 20kW more than the RAV4) and economy. And the E-Four AWD is standard on all models.\n\nPrice $69,990-$83,990 Powertrain 2.5-litre petrol engine with hybrid electric system, CVT, AWD Power/torque 184kW(combined)/242Nm Consumption 5.6l/100km\n\nRead DRIVEN Car Guide's review of the Toyota Highlander\n\nGWM CANNON ALPHA ULTRA\n\nCannon Alpha will always have one claim to fame: it's the first full-hybrid ute to officially go on sale in NZ. Or maybe that should be \"pickup truck\", because the GWM is one size larger than one-tonners like the Ford Ranger and Toyota Hilux, even if it's not quite US-sized.\n\nGWM sells diesel Alphas too, but the hybrid is powered by a 2.0-litre turbo-petrol and electrification including a motor integrated into the transmission. And yes, if you think it looks a lot like the Tank 500 (keep scrolling for that one), it is: virtually identical from the C-pillar forward.\n\nThe Lexus has always been the Japanese maker's take on the traditional European compact-executive sedan: three-box design, rear-drive chassis, rather driver-centric.\n\nWhile the brand still offers four and six-cylinder powertrains, the hybrid models have come to the fore in recent years. There's a broad range on offer, from entry-level to luxury Limited to F Sport (which also has a sportier chassis), but all with the same basic powertrain and performance.\n\nNow that's your full size! The Tank 500 picks up the hybrid powertrain from the smaller retro-style 300, but packages it in a highly luxurious 7-seat SUV. A lot less heritage look, a lot more... chrome.\n\nThe 500 is still a very serious 4x4 though, with a full ladder-frame chassis and low range. It also provides the base for GWM's tough new Cannon Alpha ute.\n\nThe ES luxury sedan has come a long way from the \"Camry with a cellphone\" jibes of two decades ago; although it still owes a lot to its mainstream Toyota sibling, being based on a similar front-drive architecture. It no longer comes with a wired-in cellphone though!\n\nIn look and feel, the ES aims to give a little taste of the super-luxury ambience of the larger LS. The hybrid powertrain (there are no conventional petrol models offered) is the same no matter whether you choose the standard, Limited or F Sport model.\n\nThere's an all-new NX in town and it won't surprise you to learn to every version is electrified. The two core models featured here are petrol-electric hybrids with lithium-ion batteries, but there's also a flagship model with PHEV power.\n\nThe hybrids feature a clever E-Four AWD system (also used for the Toyota RAV4 and larger Lexus RX) that leaves the rear axle powered solely by an electric motor, giving very precise control in open-road or low-traction conditions.\n\nThe all-new 4th-generation Santa Fe has been launched in NZ as a hybrid only; surprising as it may seem for this 7-seat SUV, a diesel engine is no longer available globally.\n\nThe Santa Fe Hybrid comes in three specification levels, including a new flagship Calligraphy model that offers a no-cost-option of switching out the 7-seat configuration for a 6-seat layout with two luxury \"captain's chairs\" in the centre row.\n\nThe RX was Lexus's original hybrid SUV, and a pioneering \"performance hybrid\" in its own right in the late-1990s. Five generations later, it's still available with conventional petrol power, but hybrid technology is very much at the forefront of the range.\n\nThe all-new RX hybrid has moved to four-cylinder engine, but there's a distinct step up from the 350h to the flagship 500h F Sport Performance, which has a lot more power from a turbo engine (a first for a Toyota/Lexus hybrid) and eschews the CVT gearbox for a more driver-focused six-speed automatic.\n\nLexus has gone to town on its GT-style coupe, the LC. It's been around for a while now, since 2017, but has lost little of its impact. It's available with both traditional V8 (coupe and convertible) and hybrid (coupe only) powertrains.\n\nThe LC's hybrid setup is worth a special mention. The \"multi-stage\" transmission is unique to LC and combines the usual CVT with a separate four-stage automatic transmission on the rear axle. The powertrain mixes and matches the two depending on the driving requirements, giving the car a very different feel to other Lexus petrol-electric models.\n\nIt was the super-luxury LS sedan that started Lexus off back in the 1980s, as a rival and wake-up call to the likes of the BMW 7-Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The latest model still aims to be a showcase of quality and technology.\n\nIt matches a 3.5-litre petrol V6 to a hybrid electric system, rear-drive with air suspension. It's certainly hard to beat the refinement of a hybrid powertrain in a super-luxury sedan.\n\nThere's a new king of the hybrids in NZ, although it's not a Toyota-style eco-car... by a long stretch.\n\nThe E-Ray is the fastest Corvette C8 you can, taking the standard 6.2-litre V8 engine and adding a 119kW/169kW electric motor in the front axle. It's also the first AWD Corvette.",

        "body": "The Forester has been a staple of Subaru's lineup since the late 1990s when it was an early example of the contemporary compact crossover form factor. Subaru has completely redesigned the Forester for the new model year and gives us a variant we've been wanting for years: a hybrid. The 2025 Subaru Forester competes with other compact SUVs including the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, and Nissan Rogue.\n\nWhat's New\n\nWhat We Think\n\nSubaru's compact SUV has never been the quickest or most exciting vehicle, but its huge cabin, generous cargo area, and airy outward visibility contribute to its practical appeal. Wide-opening rear doors make child seat installation easy. Great safety ratings please parental buyers, too. These are traits drivers appreciated about the outgoing model, and Subaru did well to engineer them into the redesigned 2025 Forester.\n\nSubaru has taken steps to improve the 2025 Forester's driving experience, which has historically been a bit disappointing. We've criticized the outgoing model's sole engine, a wheezy and underpowered 2.5-liter flat-four. Although the engine loses a bit of power and only gains a little torque for 2025, Subaru claims it has improved drive mode settings and the standard CVT's refinement as part of the redesign, although our testing reveals it's actually slightly slower than before. A new hybrid option could further improve the Forester's powertrain, but don't expect a plug-in hybrid to be introduced any time soon.\n\nSubaru has addressed our other complaint about driver engagement, with a new steering rack borrowed from the WRX sport sedan, standard active torque vectoring, and a 10-percent stiffer chassis. The automaker has loaded the Forester up with new tech, too, including an 11.6-inch touchscreen that's available on higher trim levels. While we expect the Forester's handling to improve, we don't think the automaker is pushing hard enough to keep its in-cabin tech competitive with rivals using state-of-the-art displays. Fortunately, Subaru has upgraded its EyeSight suite of active safety features, which should help bolster the Forester's appeal among new and returning buyers.\n\nSubaru appears to have remedied many of the fifth-generation model's flaws. We never shied away from recommending the previous iteration of this compact SUV to prospective buyers, and this redesigned 2025 model carries on that tradition -- even though it's still not very interesting.\n\nWhy We Rank the 2025 Forester the Way We Do (MT Score: 8.5/10)\n\nThe 2025 Subaru Forester is ranked fifth out of 14 compact SUVs in MotorTrend's Ultimate Car Rankings. Last updated October 2024.\n\nPerformance and Efficiency\n\nLike the previous-generation model, Subaru equips the new Forester with a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated flat-four engine. Power drops to 180 hp from 182 hp while torque climbs from 176 lb-ft to 178 lb-ft when compared to the 2024 Forester. A CVT, retuned for smoothness and quietness, is standard along with the automaker's signature Symmetrical AWD system. Fuel economy comes in at 26/33 mpg city/highway, or 25/32 mpg on Sport and Touring models.\n\nWith changes made to the transmission, steering, and chassis, we'd hoped that the 2025 Forester would be more engaging to drive than the 2024 model. However, our testing produced an 8.7-second 0-60 mph time, a slow result that's 0.2 second slower than its predecessor. Although the more rigid chassis seems to help lessen cabin noise, it and the WRX-derived steering system don't do anything to bring excitement; handling test results were also slightly worse than before.\n\nWhat to Expect From the 2025 Subaru Forester Hybrid\n\nFinally, a Subaru Forester Hybrid is on the way. Boasting an electric motor in addition to the Forester's existing 2.5-liter four-cylinder boxer engine, the Forester Hybrid could pump out around 200 hp. Subaru will likely target fuel economy in the same ballpark as the 2024 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid's EPA-rated 41/38 mpg city/highway and the 2024 Honda CR-V AWD Hybrid's 40/34 mpg. Thanks to the efficient drivetrain, we anticipate that the new model will deliver driving range well beyond 500 miles. Expect pricing to begin around $35,000.\n\nFor additional peace of mind, the 2025 Subaru Forester comes equipped with the EyeSight suite of active driver assistance features, including automatic emergency barking, lane keep assist, and adaptive cruise control. Subaru says that EyeSight's functions have been improved to operate more smoothly and more quickly under an increased range of conditions compared to previous installations. Changes made to the Forester to enable this upgrade include a wider field of view, updated control software, and the addition of an electric brake booster. Subaru also equips the 2025 Forester with reverse automatic braking, blind-spot detection with lane change assist, and rear cross-traffic alert. Models equipped at the Touring trim level receive standard DriverFocus Distraction Mitigation System, which uses a camera to monitor fatigue and alertness. Subaru also offers a 360-degree camera to make navigating tight parking spots easier.\n\nCargo Space and Interior Room\n\nAlthough the new 2025 Forester provides abundant passenger space, its cargo capacity is markedly less than in some of its closest competitors.\n\nTechnology\n\nOn base models, the 2025 Subaru Forester comes with dual 7.0-inch touchscreen displays. The unit on top controls infotainment features including Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Bluetooth audio, and radio functionality. The bottom screen supports climate control and vehicle settings. But on most trims, you'll find a vertically oriented 11.6-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Other notable tech includes an updated standard-dual zone HVAC that focuses on occupied seats for efficiency and passenger comfort and a kick sensor-activated power tailgate.\n\nWill There Be a 2025 Subaru Forester Wilderness?\n\nSubaru will almost certainly add a Wilderness trim level to the 2025 Forester lineup. This popular off-road package has been a hit for the midsize Outback, redesigned Crosstrek, and previous-generation Forester. As such, we would be surprised if Subaru doesn't unveil a Forester Wilderness in the first half of 2025.\n\nExpect equipment to match or build on the features offered for 2024: a suspension lift, all-terrain tires, thicker underbody skid plates, CVT tuning optimized for off-road driving, and special X-Mode drive profiles for rough terrain or slippery surfaces. The 2025 Forester Wilderness will likely come with the usual cosmetic tweaks, including gold exterior details and water-resistant interior upholstery. The previous model was decently capable off-road, but Subaru could take steps to make the next Forester Wilderness even more rugged.\n\nPrices and On-Sale Date\n\nWhen it arrives in dealerships in spring 2024, the new Forester will be available in five trims: Base, Premium, Sport, Limited, and Touring. Hybrid models will go on sale later. As for pricing, the 2025 Forester could start at around $28,500 and reach almost $40,000 on top-spec variants.\n\nThe more stylish 2025 Subaru Forester deserves a powertrain with more punch.\n\nAlisa Priddle - Writer; Jim Fets - Photographer | Aug 15, 2024\n\nSubaru added the Forester compact crossover to the U.S. lineup in 1997, and it has been a stalwart for the brand since. The last major refresh was for the 2022 model year, followed by some minor updates for 2024, and now for 2025 Subaru is introducing a sleek new sixth-generation Forester with a choice of five trim levels. Designers worked overtime to create a more stylish look both inside and out for the traditionally dowdy SUV, while the engineers are finally adding a hybrid to the powertrain options for North American buyers who'd lost patience and turned to the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 hybrids for better fuel economy (though they'll have to wait until spring 2025 for it to arrive).\n\nWhy It's Important\n\nThe Subaru Forester compact crossover is a bread-and-butter vehicle for the automaker. The 2024 Forester is ranked fifth in the competitive compact SUV segment in the MotorTrend Buyer's Guide Ultimate Car Rankings, up against heavyweights such as the RAV4 and CR-V. Subaru knows its audience well and does not change the recipe too much, because its loyal consumer base doesn't seek or reward big changes. Here Subaru has updated the onboard technology, and it's created a quieter and more comfortable interior.\n\nWe tested a 2025 Subaru Forester Touring with a 2.5-liter horizontally opposed (Boxer) four-cylinder engine that generates 180 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque. It's paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) and is EPA-rated at 25/32/28 mpg city/highway/combined, which is slightly worse than the outgoing model, likely because the carryover powertrain propels a slightly heavier vehicle.\n\nPros: What We Like\n\nThe interior is the big upgrade. We applaud the material choices, with a creative mix of textures and colors to make it feel upscale and stylish. We especially like the geometric pattern on the dashboard in front of the passenger and topographic map detail on the doors, which doubles as an accessory door protector ($178). The cabin is comfortable and spacious with more legroom in both rows than most in the segment, but it means less cargo room when the second-row seats are upright. Overall cargo room with the seats folded is competitive, though, offering lots of storage space -- and now there's a foot-activated, hands-free power rear gate. The outward visibility is incredible with the Forester's low dash and thin A-pillars. Tall testers appreciated the position of the rearview mirror, which is high enough to be out of the forward view.\n\nSubaru is upfront about its vehicles being designed to look like hiking boots, which may underscore the adventurous lifestyle the brand caters to -- but there are few hiking boots on fashion runways. Still, the 2025 Forester enjoys a sleeker look, and in Horizon Blue Pearl paint with 19-inch alloy wheels, it's a nice improvement that won't turn off traditionalists and might rope in those who had to squint to see the beauty in the past.\n\nRide quality is quite good up until you hit a large hump or dip, which gives you a big vertical bounce. It's great over cracks, potholes, and expansion joints, but something needs to be done about the excessive rebound on those large-amplitude events. As before, the Forester feels ready to tackle terrain other car-based compact SUVs might quiver at, so the ride trade-off seems geared toward light-duty off-roading at the expense of some on-road refinement.\n\nCons: What We Don't Like\n\nIt has become a common refrain at MotorTrend when it comes to Subaru: More power, please. Driving a Forester is perfectly adequate, but there's no turbo for greater performance, and we continue to be underwhelmed by the standard 2.5-liter boxer engine. The sad part is there were turbocharged engines for past Foresters, but this generation carries over the slightly anemic naturally aspirated flat-four. Hopefully the hybrid will feel sprightlier off the line. This 2.5-liter took 8.6 seconds to get from 0 to 60 mph in our testing and 16.7 seconds for the quarter mile. That's slightly slower than the outgoing model and can't match the 2024 Toyota RAV4 XLE AWD's 8.0-second time to 60 mph and 16.2 second quarter-mile time. Consolation prize: The 2023 CR-V AWD is slower at 8.7 seconds and 16.7 seconds for the quarter mile, but it also gives up a full liter of engine displacement to the Subie (even if it adds a turbo).\n\nOur testers described the Forester as gutless under 4,000 rpm and breathless above that. The SUV may not need to be much quicker to 60 mph, but it does need more low-end torque to make it tolerable in city and suburban traffic and not feel sluggish. In terms of lateral acceleration, the 0.81 g and 28.1 seconds at 0.61 g are almost identical to the RAV4, albeit slower than the Toyota's 27.6 seconds.\n\nWe applaud the Forester's safety record and standard EyeSight driver assist technology. While updated, the constant beeping warning of traffic movements around the vehicle can still be annoying and the lane keeping is aggressive in its mission to keep the SUV between the lines.\n\nOur tester had the upgraded 11.6-inch touchscreen, but Subaru still lags the competition with its infotainment system, which is slow in operation and not particularly sexy to look at. We asked the car for directions three minutes into a drive, and it said the navigation system wasn't ready -- no modern system should take this long to load.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSubaru fans will embrace the new Forester and its improved looks, especially the interior that's quiet and more attractive, but they should not expect better performance from a powertrain with a history of being underpowered. If they've owned past Foresters -- non-turbo ones, at least -- this won't be much of a surprise, but to outsiders wooed by the new sheetmetal, disappointment lurks.\n\nThe new gas model's performance and efficiency have us asking if the hybrid version might be the version we want.\n\nBob Hernandez - Writer; Brian Vance - Photographer | Jul 22, 2024\n\nAll eyes will be on the hybrid version of the redesigned 2025 Subaru Forester when that compact SUV makes its debut later in 2024. For now, Subaru is getting gas variants of the 2025 model into consumers' hands. The new sixth-generation Forester again features a 2.5-liter flat-four engine, CVT automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive -- but its exterior and interior are completely revamped. The chassis is also stiffer, and several key technologies are added or upgraded.\n\nSubaru provided us with a 2025 Forester Sport to test, the middle trim of the (as of now) five-model range. We were curious if brake pedal feel improved relative to the previous model and if body motions are better controlled. We also wanted to see if any of the things we liked about the last Forester -- namely its relaxed ride and excellent outward visibility -- were strengthened or compromised.\n\nBig Glass\n\nThe new 2025 Subaru Forester indeed delivers another great Subaru greenhouse. Outward visibility is excellent, and the large windows help the interior feel even more spacious than it is.\n\nNot that it needed much help. Passenger legroom continues to be better than what's offered by some prominent segment peers, like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. There's also a bit more cargo capacity in the Forester this year versus last, 0.7 cubic foot more for 29.6 cubes seats-up and 0.2 cubic foot more for 74.4 cubes maximum (with the standard roof). That said, the 2024 RAV4 still offers 8.0 cubic feet more standard volume at 37.6 cubes, though less max space of only 69.8 cubic feet.\n\nMaking Life Mostly Easier, Better\n\nEven with a decent 8.7 inches of ground clearance, it's easy enough for adults to move in and out of the compact SUV, and the rear doors swing out until they're nearly perpendicular to the vehicle. Further back, a newly standard eight utility hooks in the hold -- including two in the rear headliner -- offer all kinds of hanging and some anchoring potential.\n\nThe Forester Sport trim features niceties like tinted windows, a power driver seat, reclining rear seats, power panoramic sunroof, rear AC vents, three additional USB ports (four total), and a tonneau cover with an adjustable front flap. It also gets the new 11.6-inch vertical touchscreen upgrade with new wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and CarPlay worked well for us.\n\nOur 2025 Forester Sport test SUV also came with standard StarTex upholstery, which felt and looked reasonably premium. (We saw a similar-looking fabric in a much more expensive Audi RS6 wagon on test day.) That said, the water-repellent StarTex made from urethane and recycled materials didn't exactly breathe all that well on our two-hour drive home from the test track.\n\nSpeaking of materials, we give Subaru props for its creative approach to the Forester interior's hard plastics and floormats. Look low on the doors and their thresholds or in the cargo hold, and you'll be treated to creative patterns and what look like topographic map features molded into the panels (see if you can find the tiny footprints).\n\nThis Forester Sport also came with the only optional package available for 2025. The $1,700 equipment group includes reverse automatic emergency braking, a hands-free liftgate, and an 11-speaker Harman Kardon sound system.\n\nEfficiency Slips\n\nThe powertrain in the 2025 Subaru Forester is essentially the same as the last one. It returns slightly worse fuel economy than the 2024's EPA ratings of 26/33 mpg city/highway. Still, it's competitive with non-LE and non-TRD Off-Road versions of the gas-only 2024 RAV4 AWD, which return 25/33 mpg.\n\nThe Subaru also comes with a 16.6-gallon fuel tank, 2.1 gallons larger than the Toyota's, meaning it can drive up to 465 miles on a single tank, roughly 60 miles more than the RAV4.\n\nStill Dog Slow\n\nWe called out the previous Forester Touring for its mix of an unexciting powertrain and considerable mass. The 2025 Sport we have is even heavier by 40 pounds and, not surprisingly, turned out to be slower in a straight line -- 8.7 seconds to 60 mph and 16.7 seconds in the quarter mile, 0.2 second drops in both metrics from the previous model. The 2024 Toyota RAV4 XLE AWD is 0.7 second quicker to 60 mph, doing it in 8.0, and can run the quarter in 16.2 seconds, 0.5 second quicker.\n\nFor the swiftest everyday launches, the Forester prefers smooth, measured throttle inputs. Switching off traction control and using pedal overlap as we did requires keeping the revs high to find a sweet spot/defeat the CVT, which is not recommended in regular driving.\n\nThis Subaru was also a tiny bit worse through our lateral acceleration and racetrack-in-a-bottle figure-eight tests -- 0.80 g and 27.8 seconds at 0.59 average g, fractions of seconds and g loads worse than before. Its numbers are only slightly behind the RAV4's lateral g average of 0.81 g and figure-eight average of 27.6 seconds at 0.61 g.\n\nCushy Ride, Shorter Stops\n\nSuffice it to say, the 2025 Subaru Forester Sport is not an enthusiast model. Mash the throttle, and the engine gets louder, but the compact SUV doesn't exactly get commensurately quicker. The WRX-derived steering feels light and a touch disconnected, but it's responsive. The Forester's suspension is decidedly compliant and comfortable, but driving the car at its limits elicits plenty of body roll and midcorner understeer.\n\nStill, because of this Forester's newfound stiffness, the ride is noticeably more silent. We saw it during our first drive and again during testing. Less harshness comes through the chassis, but wind noise is still present.\n\nThere's also some dive during sudden stops. Luckily, we experienced no concerning wiggles as the Forester came to a halt, and the brake system itself was effective if a little unrefined. Our best stop from 60 mph was our first one at 123 feet, which was 2 feet shorter than the last Forester's best but also 2 feet shy of the 2024 RAV4s.\n\nPricing\n\nWith the one optional package, this 2025 Subaru Forester Sport's as-tested price came out to $37,590. That's a competitive MSRP given a comparably equipped 2024 Toyota RAV4 Limited carries a $39,730 sticker, while Honda asks $37,850 for its 2025 CR-V EX-L AWD. The next model down the Forester trim walk, the $2,500-cheaper Premium version, isn't available with 19-inch wheels, StarTex upholstery, or mirror-integrated turn signals -- you must make do with 17s, cloth seats, and regular blinkers.\n\nWho's the Forester For?\n\nAnyone looking at gasoline-powered versions of the RAV4 or CR-V should also consider a new Forester, especially if trails or rough weather are things you think your vehicle could face. The Subaru faithful should dig the new model, too. It's more spacious and quieter to travel in than before. Drivability improves ever so slightly with the added torque, and we dig the brand's impulse to add some styling flair.\n\nUnfortunately, the new crossover compact SUV is both less athletic and less efficient than before. It also may be time for Subaru to rethink its one-size-fits-all infotainment touchscreen, which strikes us as too ubiquitous across the company's full lineup. But the Forester is far from a penalty box -- it can be charming and practical in its own way. Given its shortcomings, though, we're inclined to think the forthcoming hybrid model might turn out to be the version everyone's really been waiting for.\n\nThe Forester's improved handling, powertrain, safety, and tech helped get us back on track.\n\nMatthew Chudzinski - Writer; Manufacturer - Photographer | May 06, 2024\n\nIf -- hypothetically speaking, of course -- we found ourselves without cell service or GPS, we would be just as helpless as everyone else whose memory of a pre-Google Maps world is fading. How do we know? We trekked out to the Paws Up Ranch in Montana to drive the new 2025 Subaru Forester and found out firsthand when we got lost in the kind of way that's only possible in the forest-covered mountains of Big Sky Country.\n\nSubaru gave us great written directions, but missing a turn by less than a half-mile landed us in a spot with identical landmarks and mileage cues as the road we needed. We'd love to say we adventured off the prescribed route in the spirit of testing Subaru's newest model and exploring the area's history with Lewis and Clark, feuding native tribes, ghost towns, and clandestine shortcuts. If that were the case, we would have come back to the city with a tale much taller than, \"Oops, we made a wrong turn.\" What we did take away was the realest experience of the new Forester possible through gravel dirt, mud, snow, highways, and mountains.\n\nImprovements That Matter\n\nThe cost of all Foresters increases by about $2,600 for 2025, but current owners will have no problem figuring out where some of their extra money is spent. As we left the 37,000-plus-acre ranch, the gravel and dirt road leading out seemed quieter than we expected. We drove the range-topping Touring trim, but the entire lineup has improved sound-deadening material in the floor, roof, fenders, and firewall, and it makes a difference that you can hear. Or maybe it's more accurate to say you can't hear it. Throughout the day, road impacts on all surfaces were so well damped that we steered toward each new obstacle and imperfection as a chance to test the Subie. Tire and wind noise are still present at highway speeds but kept to a level that won't make speaking to second-row passengers or listening to a podcast a chore. This kind of quietness makes the extra spend and the $41,390 needed to take home a Forester Touring seem perfectly reasonable.\n\nBetter Chassis, Better Ride\n\nEven before we unintentionally forged our own path, our ride was filled with winding gravel and dirt roads. The dull roar of loud tires on the paved roads can be annoying, but rough gravel roads excite the wheels and chassis with high-frequency impacts that will twist a chassis and create squeaks and rattles in the process. Rocks bombarding the inner fenders and floor of any vehicle are not pleasant to listen to and create the sense that something is definitely going to break.\n\nThese types of unwanted noises were eliminated by changing how the Forester is built. Subaru planned the unibody assembly around having access to the areas the needed the biggest improvements. The new Forester has more welds and three times more structural adhesive to fill gaps and increase stiffness in areas that can cause squeaks and rattles. The improvements amount to 10 percent better torsional rigidity, Subaru says, making for a drive that's not only quieter but also more enjoyable because you won't wince at every pothole.\n\nNot Speedy But Mighty\n\nThe updated chassis doesn't just help with interior sound quality. It improves handling in conjunction with a revised all-wheel-drive system and powertrain. The small rocks covering the rough terrain we conquered in the Forester can be like driving on marbles and often more unpredictable than ice or snow. Subaru's full-time symmetrical AWD tackled it well, with updated controls to anticipate vehicle weight transfer. By considering steering angle, the system can now proactively adjust torque between front and rear wheels for a smoother and more predictable line through a corner. That stability let us rip through turns with confidence and ease. The Forester might be best known for hauling around pets, kids, and camping gear, but it handles more like a quieter WRX than you would expect.\n\nThe engine is the reminder that the Forester is not a WRX of any kind, and it's the one place we wish Subaru had made bigger gains. When we made it to our first highway section, the not-so-peppy 180 hp from last year's engine left us wanting more -- not more performance, just a bit more hustle. Loaded up with two adults and camera gear, the weight of our cargo didn't amount to more than an afternoon picnic. As the Forester gets heavier, you really start to notice just how few horses are pulling it.\n\nBut nothing was left untouched in the new Forester, so here's the big engine update: Two more lb-ft of torque! OK, that's not it. The real improvement was shifting the peak torque down from 5,400 to 3,700 rpm. Subaru engineers were apparently surprised to learn what anybody who has driven I-70 west of Denver already knows: Forester owners rarely visit the top half of the tachometer. For Subaru's clientele, this change should deliver a bigger benefit than more power. Horsepower might get work done quickly, but the torque is what dictates how much work an engine can do. The 3,000-4,000-rpm range is the sweet spot in most conditions, so the muscle needed is never far away. The engine also has new rocker covers, a new upper oil pan, new mounts, and a new starter that all contribute to less perceptible engine noise and vibration.\n\nTo make better use of available power and torque, all 2025 models adopt the continuously variable transmission from the 2024 Forester Wilderness, which had a wider ratio spread and eight calibrated ratios to mimic an automatic transmission instead of the seven simulated gears in other versions. Paddle shifters are included in Sport models and above.\n\nHas Subaru kept any surprises in reserve for the 2025 Forester Wilderness? We won't know until later this year when it is released. The 2024 Wilderness was so popular that it is still in production to meet demand. We're looking forward to what the revision holds, because with 8.7 inches of ground clearance, the Forester offers more than enough capability for most buyers.\n\nWhat Goes Up Must Come Down\n\nThere is some actual WRX DNA in the Forester in the electric dual-pinion steering rack, which is also found in the Subaru Crosstrek. In the outgoing Forester, the assist motors worked through the steering column, which reduces feel. The new rack-mounted motor reinforced our inputs and contributed to the confident feel of the chassis, AWD, and torque delivery.\n\nThis is where getting lost put all the mechanical updates together in a way that we wouldn't have otherwise experienced. With no other roads in sight, we turned off the highway onto a dirt road that somehow matched our first few landmarks, namely a couple of forks that appeared right where we expected them to. We did realize we weren't on the right path exactly, but were pretty sure -- for a while, at least -- that we had left pavement at the right spot. Our last attempt at the correct path led us up a mountain on a narrow dirt road until we found a tree blocking the road. We knew we couldn't be the first ones to encounter it, but backing down the road wasn't as appealing as finding a spot to turn around. So we moved the tree and drove on.\n\nAll that did was put us farther up a road we had to back down anyway. Craning around to stare out the back, we began a mile-long descent in reverse, giving us an opportunity to fully appreciate the great visibility through the large, upright glass. If we'd had more cargo -- possible with more tie-downs and more room between wheel arches -- the new rearview camera mirror that's standard on the Touring models and optional on others would have helped us see behind it. Combined with the 360-degree surround view, we could have made our way down using only the mirror display and the new 11.6-inch center display. The rear camera view has a prominent fish-eye effect that's distracting in normal driving, but in this situation, it focused our gaze on the narrow road well. The new display is standard on all models except the base model, which gets dual 7.0-inch displays.\n\nAs good as these features are, using our own eyes still made the process easier. The improved steering was a lifesaver while staring backward and driving with one hand. We were on an actual road, but larger rocks and sticks popped up frequently enough that we appreciated the Forester making the task easier. The suspension mitigates large body movements nearly as well as an active damping system might. And as we continued down our winding road backward, the variable torque distribution driven by the steering input kept everything stable. We don't typically review cars based on driving them backward down mountains, but because we had to, it magnified everything that already impressed us with the ride and handling.\n\nGo Anywhere, Do Anything\n\nHopefully you don't ever find yourself in the same situation, but we would be lying if we said it wasn't fun. The Forester helped by leaning into the adventure and ensuring we didn't have to deal with a fussy, incapable car. Subaru knows its customers lead active lifestyles and travel beyond the pavement occasionally. The Forester delivers the versatility and confidence these drivers need. Not every Forester owner is going to be a driving enthusiast the way a WRX or a BRZ driver might be, but they will appreciate their crossover as a necessary tool in their life and adventures. Keep the ground clearance in check, and you will be hard pressed to find a road the Forester can't handle with almost anyone behind the wheel.\n\nPlus, the Wilderness returns, but not quite how we expected it.\n\nAlex Kierstein - Writer | Apr 05, 2024\n\nA very popular all-wheel-drive crossover, the Subaru Forester SUV, is back in all-new form for the 2025 model year. And now we have pricing for the renewed and revitalized midsize SUV. The new 2025 Forester is a handsome thing, not that its styling has diverged much from its 2024 predecessor. But, for a Subaru redesign, it's a successful reimagining of the Forester itself without veering into the controversial or strange. And that styling (and other content changes) do come at a slight premium.\n\nThe 2025 Subaru Forester now starts at $31,090. That represents a $2,650 increase over the outgoing base-trim 2024 Forester. There seems to be more here for your money, however. For example, the old Forester only had a single 6.5-inch Starlink multimedia screen, while the new 2025 Forester offers dual 7-inch units, although still with wired CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nFeatures like LED Steering Response Headlights remain. Subaru claims the new Forester is quieter, too, thanks to additional sound-deadening. And EyeSight has been revised to identify obstacles like pedestrians more quickly. Other changes include an Emergency Stop Assist feature that can bring the SUV to a complete stop for the first time if it detects a driver that is not responding to prompts to retake control of the vehicle when the Advanced Adaptive Cruise Control system is active. Some safety systems are still reserved for higher-trim models. For example, Blind Spot Detection isn't available until you get to the Premium trim, but even then you'll have to add a $1,200 options package bundled with a power rear liftgate to get it. It's standard on Sport trims and above.\n\nThat said, the Premium trim does offer the newer vertically oriented 11.6-inch Multimedia Plus infotainment system, which we've seen on other Subaru models of late. This system does bring wireless CarPlay and Android Auto functionality.\n\nAlmost the entirety of the trim walk -- Premium, Sport, Limited, and Touring -- follows a similar moderate price increase structure. There's one important exception: the Forester Wilderness. At this time, it won't be a model year 2025 vehicle. Instead, the previous-gen 2024 Forester Wilderness will carry over and be sold alongside the newer, restyled, and up-contented 2025 models. Its price is unchanged, at $36,265. Perhaps the Wilderness version of the newer body style will appear later in this model year, or as a 2026 model.\n\nLastly, there's no word yet about the 2025 Forester Hybrid that was recently announced, and will use a Toyota-sourced hybrid powertrain. Perhaps we'll have what amounts to a 2025.5 model year introduction of both the Wilderness and the Hybrid around the same time. We expect the Forester Hybrid to be a conventional, not plug-in, hybrid and we presume it will start around $35,000 when it eventually goes on sale.\n\n2025 Subaru Forester Pricing\n\nSubaru is set to finally offer a hybrid Forester for the U.S.\n\nZach Gale - Writer; Darren Martin - Photographer; Manufacturer - Photographer | Nov 20, 2023\n\nCheck one off the forbidden-fruit list. With the 2025 Subaru Forester hybrid, the automaker is finally bringing to the U.S. the latest version of a model that's lived in Europe for years. Toyota and Honda should take note of the 2025 Forester hybrid, which fills one of the most gaping holes in Subaru's lineup. As Honda brags that more than half of all CR-V sales are hybrids and Toyota sells more RAV4 Hybrids than any other hybrid model in its lineup, the time is right for this Subaru -- that is, if it gets the formula right. (Editor's Note: The non-hybrid 2025 Subaru Forester is shown here.)\n\nThe 2025 Forester hybrid is clearly intended to keep Subaru drivers in the family and steal buyers away from the CR-V and RAV4 hybrids. That assumes of course that Subaru doesn't make the same mistakes it did with the plug-in hybrid Crosstrek, a charming model that didn't have a long enough electric-only range and was priced so high that buyers probably experienced sticker shock.\n\nGiven that plug-ins cost more than traditional hybrids, we believe Subaru will pull the plug on bringing over any 2025 Forester so equipped, especially considering that's the direction the automaker took with the outgoing Forester e-Boxer powertrain in Europe. If Subaru skips the base trim and instead starts with the Premium model for America, an affordable starting MSRP of around $35,000 is possible.\n\nSubarus often have longer driving ranges than their competitors, which we appreciated a great deal with the long-term 2020 Outback SUV we tested during the pandemic. With the 2025 Forester hybrid, expect a combined city/highway driving range of well over 500 miles. The CR-V Hybrid AWD comes in at 518 miles and the RAV4 Hybrid at 580, both offering plenty of miles before needing to stop at a gas station.\n\nAlthough the outgoing Forester e-Boxer utilized a 2.0-liter flat-four engine, we wouldn't be surprised if the new 2025 model comes equipped with Subaru's larger 2.5-liter flat-four at its core. The last Euro-spec hybrid Forester mustered only around 150 total system horsepower, with a Subaru-estimated 0-62 mph (0-100 kph) time of 11.8 seconds. That's simply not going to cut it for the U.S. market, even for those already accustomed to the current Forester. We'd be surprised if the new Forester hybrid doesn't come with just over 200 hp, all-in; the CR-V hybrid musters a total of 204 hp and the Toyota 219.\n\nAccording to a report from Motor1, Subaru of America COO Jeff Walters confirmed that the Forester Hybrid's battery pack and motor will be sourced from Toyota. Subaru could elect to change the layout of the hybrid to be similar to Toyota's Hybrid Max system, which puts the electric motor at the rear axle. However, we suspect that the packaging will match that of the outgoing Euro-spec model, which employed a motor near the engine fed by a lithium-ion battery below the cargo area. The base model 2025 Forester's cargo capacity feels relatively spacious, but at 29.6 cubic feet total with the second-row seats up, it holds less than the competition from Honda and Toyota. We're curious to see if that space suffers at all with the hybrid model.\n\nOne of Subaru's brand values is standard all-wheel drive on nearly every vehicle it sells in the U.S. That won't change here, but we have questions about the hybrid's drivetrain. Some hybrids, like the Toyota RAV4, have AWD systems with no mechanical connection between the front and rear wheels; instead, an e-motor drives the rear wheels when necessary.\n\nThe AWD system in the Honda CR-V is more of a standard mechanical setup, which is what we expect Subaru to use for the 2025 Forester. The CR-V can send up to 50 percent of the SUV's torque to the rear axle.\n\nThat type of system may deliver peace of mind, but it's not usually as efficient as an electric-motor-based setup -- compare the 2024 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid's EPA-rated 41/38 city/highway mpg to the 2024 Honda CR-V AWD Hybrid's 40/34 mpg. But let's put it this way: Even if the 2025 Forester Hybrid isn't a segment-leader in fuel economy, it'll definitely outpace the present gas-only Forester's best 26/33 mpg mark.\n\nOn the road, the outgoing Euro-market Forester e-Boxer could drive for a mile on electric power alone at up to 25 mph with a light touch on the accelerator pedal. If the 2025 Forester hybrid drives as well as the best mainstream hybrids, it'll switch seamlessly from gas to electric power, with excellent brake tuning and a slight boost in acceleration from the gas-only model.\n\nAll that remains to be seen, but the 2025 Forester hybrid will have a good starting point given what we've seen so far from the newly redesigned model. Subaru worked on improving seat comfort and quietness, perfect for a hybrid commuter.\n\nSo far, we've focused on the two best-sellers in the compact hybrid SUV segment, but the electrified CR-V and RAV4 have plenty of competition. We're fans of the Kia Sportage Hybrid, and there's also the Hyundai Tucson Hybrid, as well as the Ford Escape Hybrid. One size down, the new Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid is in a segment by itself.\n\nThough we expect the 2025 Forester hybrid to be class-competitive, we'll reserve judgment until we see real details from Subaru. But if the brand can keep the price reasonable and deliver halfway-decent performance, it may have a winner on its hands.\n\nOne of the best compact SUVs returns with a few course corrections and a new model we've wanted for years.\n\nZach Gale - Writer; Dale Martin - Photographer; Manufacturer - Photographer | Nov 17, 2023\n\nIf Subaru actually took risks, we might say the most shocking things about the 2025 Subaru Forester SUV are its WRX-sourced turbocharged powertrain and now-standard third-row seat. But the all-new model has neither of those things. It comes from a brand that prefers to stay the course, delivering exactly what its customers want and expect.\n\nAnd so the 2025 Subaru Forester enhances the outgoing model's advantages, from its reputation for safety to its all-around visibility and spaciousness. You want sporty? Get a Dodge Hornet. But if you want a very well-rounded mainstream five-seat compact SUV, the 2025 Forester appears compelling.\n\nNow With 25 Percent More Design\n\nAhead of viewing the 2025 Subaru Forester Sport and Touring models, we didn't expect to spend so much time thinking about its design. This is a Forester, after all, an against-the-grain SUV known for its superb visibility in an industry full of swoopy sheetmetal and tiny windows that can make everyday maneuvers difficult.\n\nThe 2025 Forester is still upright and easy to see out of, but the package is more styled than ever before. From headlight to taillight, the 2025 Forester is more interesting to behold, with its larger grille, enlarged badge, black trim on the A- and D-pillars, chunky wheelwell flares, and more expressive sheetmetal. In back, partially clear taillight elements make an impression. Different elements change as you ascend the 2025 Forester's lineup, which moves through base, Premium, Sport, Limited, and Touring trims. From 50 feet, the overall look is fine but as with most Subarus it gets a bit too busy once you get close enough to pick through the detailing.\n\nThe lineup isn't complete; it will eventually also include an off-road-ready Wilderness model and a Forester hybrid, a model Europeans have had for years.\n\nLess Power, More of What Matters\n\nUntil the hybrid model arrives, every 2025 Forester is powered by a 180-hp, 178-lb-ft 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder. That's 2 horsepower fewer and 2 lb-ft more than before, and we expect fuel economy to roughly match the last model's 26/33 mpg city/highway ratings. It's possible the 2025 Forester will be slightly less efficient given it's slightly heavier to help it meet new safety standards, though. The 2025 Forester should hit 60 mph in around 8.7 seconds, just behind a 2023 Forester Touring that we clocked to 60 in 8.5.\n\nIf the 2025 Forester can meet that time, it'll keep up with a non-hybrid Honda CR-V (8.7 seconds) and be slightly outpaced by a non-hybrid Toyota RAV4 (8.3 seconds). The other way to look at these numbers is to completely ignore them. Because although we all need passing power sometimes, quick and sporty performance is not the Forester's forte (same goes for most of its competitors).\n\nMore crucially, Subaru says the 2025 Forester is quieter and rides better, and the automaker has worked on seat comfort. Maybe that doesn't sound exciting, but those are exactly the types of improvements that matter in the mundane driving scenarios most customers will endure day in and day out.\n\nSubaru also says both the steering and AWD systems are more responsive than before; yes, the latter remains standard on every trim. The same is true for a CVT automatic, which is programmed for smoothness most of the time but will simulate a conventional automatic's gear shifts at wide-open throttle. Subaru promises the transmission is quieter now.\n\nAll 2025 Foresters also get Incline Start Assist, which prevents the SUV from drifting backward on a hill by briefly holding the brakes before you press the accelerator pedal. On the Sport trim and higher, a dual-function X-Mode system expands the range of conditions the AWD system can tackle, but let's be honest: Its primary purpose is to make many buyers feel like they're going on an adventure even if their biggest trek is through a rainy Whole Foods parking lot.\n\nTech: What It Has and What's Missing\n\nHere's something we saw coming: Most 2025 Subaru Foresters get an infotainment system with a 11.6-inch vertically oriented touchscreen. That's the same setup you'll find in most Subarus including the Impreza, Crosstrek, Outback, Legacy, and Ascent. Subaru has also made meaningful improvements to the display's programming, layout, and logic since our yearlong evaluation of a 2020 Outback. Some MotorTrend editors prefer horizontal displays over vertical ones, and even Tesla has moved on from the portrait-style layout. However, if you must go vertical, this is a decent system. We wish we could say that about more automakers' infotainment setups.\n\nWith the new big screen, the 2025 Forester is the latest Subaru to go nearly knobless. We'll miss the outgoing Forester's five center-stack knobs, an old-school approach we hope will come back into vogue.\n\nFor now, we have a volume knob, tuning knob, and physical but flat buttons for temperature control. On the screen, you'll find digital buttons for fan speed as well as heated and, on the Touring, ventilated seats. The 2025 Forester Touring also snags leather seats with microsuede inserts.\n\nThe Forester Touring also gets a feature that reminds us of BMW's Gesture Control tech. In Subaru's case, this is bundled with the DriverFocus Distraction Mitigation system. In the past, we've found the system itself distracting in the overbearing way it detects and alerts you to your distraction. It's possible the tech has improved, but for now our focus is instead on how it allows you to change the air temperature with hand gestures. Sounds like a fun, chuckle-worthy trick to show a passenger more than it does a useful piece of tech.\n\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are bundled with the 11.6-inch screen that's on most trims. As in other Subarus, two 7.0-inch screens take its place on base models.\n\nWhile not strictly technology, we want to mention a Forester feature we're glad to see return: the giant glass roof. As before, a large glass panel uninterrupted by a pillar tops most Foresters. It's a bit of a reach to pull the cover forward, but the glass should allow rear-seat passengers to see more trees overhead than they might in, say, a CR-V.\n\nOne feature we wish the 2025 Forester offered, at least on the top Touring trim, is a digital driver display. Using a familiar gauge layout -- a smaller digital display sandwiched by an analog tachometer and speedometer -- probably saves money. In our experience driving many other Subarus with the same setup, the small screen is well designed. A utility-focused SUV like the Forester may notneedsuch tech, but if Subaru wants to attract more first-time buyers to the brand, it may be a wise addition on this trim when the SUV is updated in a few years.\n\nThe top-dog Touring does, however, include a 360-degree camera. That's a cool feature addition, although we're told it lacks a front-wheel-focused view. Over the course of our year driving a 2023 Mazda CX-50, that SUV's well-executed 360-degree camera was a real highlight.\n\nDimensions, Cargo Space\n\nThese days, we're used to newly redesigned vehicles getting bigger. But Subaru understands that a larger package isn't always better.\n\n\"Making it bigger is not really the point,\" said Bill Stokes, car line planning manager for the 2025 Forester.\n\nThat's why the 2025 Subaru Forester is just 0.6 inch longer (now 183.3) and 0.5 inch wider (72.0). Height and ground clearance are unchanged at 68.1 and 8.7 inches, and the wheelbase is still 105.1 inches. Cargo space is up to 29.6 cubic feet from 28.9 -- a useful improvement in the practically shaped compartment but still behind the Toyota RAV4 (37.6) and Honda CR-V (39.3).\n\nIn a Boxy, Forester-Sized Nutshell\n\nThe well-rounded Subaru Forester has always prioritized comfort and visibility over sportiness and style. The 2025 Forester doesn't mess much with this formula even if the Forester has a more expressive look that some will embrace while others see as too much.\n\nWe suspect that until the hybrid and Wilderness models arrive, most buyers will appreciate the 2025 Forester's other strengths. Even in a segment with more than a dozen competitors, big power or sizzle aren't necessary. When the core of your vehicle is strong -- and you quickly sell every example you build, as Subaru has for the past two years -- you don't need to try hard to impress.\n\nWhat the Subaru's cabin gets right and wrong -- from someone with a Forester in the driveway.\n\nZach Gale - Writer; Darren Martin - Photographer; Manufacturer - Photographer | Nov 16, 2023\n\nMaybe you can relate to the 2025 Subaru Forester. Here's an SUV that's trying to be true to itself in an industry that's often more concerned about style than substance. The Forester has long eschewed any semblance of vanity in favor of basic practicality and segment-leading outward visibility. In short, tall roofs with lots of glass beneath them can look dorky, especially on boxy stuff like the Forester. So while the newest Subaru SUV holds fast to its pragmatic roots, the 2025 Forester is trying to turn over a new leaf, showing everyone how much fun its design can be.\n\nYou can see how that worked out in our deeper dive on the new Forester here, but how does it impact the SUV's useful and roomy interior? As the 2025 Subaru Forester balances these different demands, the SUV mostly gets the interior right. I just happened to have a 2020 Forester in the driveway for comparison and can see plenty that hasn't changed (thank goodness) and a few additions, as well.\n\nHere's what you should know about the 2025 Forester's interior.\n\nEaster Eggs for Everyone!\n\nFor a couple years, Subaru has had the coolest cargo-area covers in the business. We know how strange that sounds, but the automaker dresses up the cargo area with etchings of mountains, adding to the car's appeal without diminishing functionality. On the 2025 Forester, designers had fun, including outdoorsy Easter eggs if you know where to look.\n\nWe do.\n\nIn the cargo area, hunt for a small telescope on the right side of the cargo area, hidden in the lining of the wheelwell. On the left side, it's a lantern. Open the rear doors to find dog paws on the door panels, and a bird hides in the corner of the moonroof's glass above the driver's head.\n\nScreens and Knobs: Lots of One, Not Enough of the Other\n\nThe 11.6-inch vertical touchscreen in other Subarus finally enters the Forester for 2025. Some MotorTrend editors prefer horizontal screens, but if you have to go vertical, this is a decent setup.\n\nWe appreciate the way Subaru has taken clear steps to improve the layout over the years. While we drove a 2020 Outback for a year, Subaru improved the way Apple CarPlay showed on the display. More recently in Subarus with this system, the heated and ventilated seats no longer require you to tap into a separate screen to adjust -- they're always visible. The same is true with fan speed.\n\nFor the 2025 Forester, the 11.6-inch screen is available or standard on most models, and it comes with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. We tried CarPlay in person and appreciated how it filled most of the screen, with some room left on the bottom for HVAC controls.\n\nWhat's missing here are knobs. The old Forester has five knobs to handle volume, tuning, temperature, and fan speed. The new one? Just volume and tuning, with temperature handled by flat, physical buttons and fan speed on the screen. Not bad but not the most user-friendly setup.\n\nNo Big Screen Here\n\nWhere you won't find a big screen is the instrument cluster. While this certainly isn't an expectation in the compact SUV segment, we're starting to see them pop up in competitors. It's the kind of detail that could help justify a 2025 Forester Touring over the second-highest trim, the Limited.\n\nHaving said that, the vertical screen dividing the tachometer and speedometer gauges is well designed. The display makes the most of the small real estate it has, which is more than we can say about some larger screens.\n\nAhhhh\n\nEnough screen talk; how's the view outside? We're pleased to report the Forester still has good outward visibility. The rear quarter windows may have shrunk a tiny bit, but all-around visibility is still very good, thanks to the lowish beltline and tall roof. This has always been one reason to get a Forester, and that's still the case for 2025.\n\nRear-Seat Spaciousness\n\nWe don't have objective rear-seat legroom figures as this is written, but subjectively, the rear seat feels spacious enough. Reclining the rear seat is again accomplished via a small cloth strap at the base of the seat -- more convenient than the Toyota RAV4's controls on top of the seats but not as good as the big and easy-to-find levers on the side of the seats in the Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson.\n\nIf you're brave enough to let go of your phone for a few minutes, a phone-sized holder is built into the map pockets in the backs of the front seats. What we also noticed, having a last-gen Forester to compare: The rear doors still open wide but not quite as wide as before.\n\nSubaru tells us the rear seats have a stadium-style feel partly to help meet new rear-seat safety regulations from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nA Forester Trademark: The Glass Roof\n\nThe moonroof in the new Forester is essentially the same as the one in the outgoing model, which is great. The 2025 Forester's version of this popular feature is one large panel uninterrupted by a support beam in between. That makes pulling the cover open or closed a stretch, but it's great for driver and rear passengers once it's open.\n\nTouch a Panel, Any Panel\n\nAnother Subaru trait we loved on the current-gen Outback and the outgoing Forester were their soft interior panels, namely soft-touch materials on the doors and even the edges of the center stack, right where your knee rests at a long red light. For an SUV that starts just below $30,000 and tops out around $40,000, the 2025 Forester easily meets materials-quality expectations. The SUV continues where those cars left off, and the Touring trim adds suede inserts on the seats and doors.\n\nWhen we saw the 2025 Subaru Forester in person, the Touring's two-tone saddle/black seats gave the top trim level a premium look. On the 2025 Forester Sport, that model's stain-resistant black seats had tasteful bronze stitching on black seats to match the bronze 19-inch wheels.\n\nHexagons and Geometry\n\nThe Forester has never been known for its style, but Subaru has refined one styling element that appears on our family's last-gen Forester: textured trim in front of the passenger-side dash. In the 2025 model, the pleasant design features hexagons, which we're told echoes the shape of the side windows between the front and rear glass. We don't see it, but you do see the same motif at the bottom of the front and rear bumpers, as well as on the bottom of the front and rear doors.\n\nWe like the new interior hexagons, but Toyota does a better job of integrating such details, specifically on the interior of the RAV4. In that SUV, a geometric motif is repeated in the cupholders, on the wireless charger, and even on the speaker grilles.\n\nWhat About Cargo Space?\n\nWe didn't forget about cargo space, which in the 2025 Subaru Forester trails the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. Even so, the Subaru's 29.6 cubic feet of space feels plentiful with its wide opening. We wish the cargo cover lifted when you open the liftgate, but that's a small detail. Where Subaru got it right is including simple controls to fold down the 60/40-split rear seats from the cargo area. Do that, and you have 74.4 cubic feet of space to fill.\n\nPut It All Together\n\nThe 2025 Subaru Forester's interior has more pros than cons, but there are a few drawbacks. Even though the 11.6-inch vertical touchscreen has improved, it's still not a best-in-class infotainment system. Also, one day we'd like the top Touring trim to offer a digital instrument cluster if Subaru is now paying more attention to the emotional aspect of buying a car.\n\nHowever, visibility is solid, and the SUV feels spacious without making a compact parking spot feel awkwardly tight. Thankfully, soft interior materials have returned on this generation, too. In other words, the Forester's trademark values balance out the negatives on a nameplate that's closing in on 30 years on the market.\n\nAttracting new customers without alienating existing ones is a tough design challenge.\n\nZach Gale - Writer | Nov 15, 2023\n\nMore is not always more. For years, the Subaru Forester has found success with a box-it-came-in design against rivals like the Hyundai Tucson and Nissan Rogue. Good visibility is part of how the Forester built its reputation, but owners had a message for Subaru when it designed the new one: Can you make it more stylish?\n\nThat sounds like an obvious priority for any redesign, but go too far and you lose what's made the Forester a Forester over its five generations. P racticality is a big deal for the 2025 Subaru Forester . Walk around the 2025 Subaru Forester in person, however, and it feels a little different this time.\n\nTime to Conquest CR-V and RAV4\n\nGet close to the new SUV and a number of design details start to attract your gaze. Bill Stokes, car line planning manager for the 2025 Forester, tells us that's no accident. S ome conquest buyers don't even consider the Forester because of its design. They want a more refined look, he says.\n\nSo the 2025 Forester goes for a more stand-out design. Stokes confirms what we pretty much already knew: The Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 are on what feels like everyone's shopping list. To get Subaru in the picture for more of those buyers, the 2025 Forester had to make some changes.\n\nThe biggest change isn't that the badge is literally bigger than before, but the exaggerated surfacing on the sheetmetal. The 2025 Forester's wheelbase is unchanged from the last one and length is only 0.6 inches longer, but the new SUV tries to look more substantial. Boxier, contrasting wheel flares replace rounded ones from the last-gen SUV, and that shape is echoed by the metal in a more pronounced way than before.\n\nMore Details the Closer You Get\n\nAn aerodynamic aid on the front fender flares catches your attention, and textured hexagonal trim appears on the bottom of the doors. The 19-inch wheels on the Touring and Sport are one inch larger than the last-gen Forester offered, but the look is a bit busy on both models. The multi-spoke design has a fang-like design pattern (cool!) and gray spokes with strakes that contrast with polished spokes. It's a lot.\n\nUp front, the 2025 Forester's larger grille resembles that of its predecessor, but there's more detailing. A few thick horizontal lines mix with thinner vertical ones below the Subaru badge, while above it there's a grille-like opening that subtly reminds us of the last-gen Toyota Tundra.\n\nMove to the edge of the hood and you'll see a black plastic panel that defines the bottom of the A-pillar. In back, a matching panel on the D-pillar serves as a backdrop for badging. \"Symmetrical AWD\" is displayed in silver on the Touring model we saw, and the Sport model gets an attractive copper background for the same badge.\n\n\"FORESTER\" is imprinted on the decklid, a neat touch, and partially clear taillights are new, complete with a silver design element that reminds us of a floss pick, but a very premium one at that. We're guessing you're supposed to see a half-hexagon there and in the side of the headlights as that shape appears in the interior on the passenger-side dash, too.\n\n2025 Forester: Buy For Its Design?\n\nFunctionality remains the best reason to get a 2025 Subaru Forester, not design. Considering Subaru had supply issues for a while on the last-gen model, it should have no problem selling to brand-loyal buyers, and we'll see what the response is from folks who are new to the brand.\n\nWe wouldn't call the new design as clean as the last-gen, as rugged-looking as the Toyota RAV4, or as beautiful as the Mazda CX-5, but it is different. The 2025 Forester makes a louder statement without getting too wild .\n\nOn Subaru's website, you can't miss it. The Crosstrek page shows a Crosstrek Wilderness heroically traversing a dusty trail, splashing through water. Move to Outback, and the first thing you see is an Outback Wilderness mightily climbing a steep trail on the side of a mountain. As for the Forester ? A Forester Wilderness navigates a muddy trail in what appears to be -- wait for it -- a forest. Now that the newly redesigned 2025 Subaru Forester has made its debut , we have no doubt that a Wilderness model is coming, possibly before the end of the 2025 model year.\n\nFor now, the 2025 Forester lineup includes base, Premium, Sport, Limited, and Touring models, just like last time. A hybrid model will be a later addition.\n\nSubaru admits that Forester drivers don't go off road as much as those who drive Crosstreks or Outbacks, but a 2025 Forester Wilderness should still be on the way with much more than big badges and chunkier body cladding. The special SUV will have those too, but we appreciate how much Subaru upgraded on the last-gen Forester Wilderness . We expect the 2025 version will match the outgoing SUV's 9.2 inches of ground clearance, a half-inch lift from the standard models.\n\nTo keep the base price down, the 2025 Forester Wilderness may use the standard model's 180-hp 2.5-liter flat-four with a retuned CVT automatic. Fuel economy will suffer as a result, but that hasn't stopped the popularity of existing Wilderness models. And there's always the possibility that Subaru will one day offer a 2025 Forester Wilderness hybrid. If that doesn't happen, power-hungry Wilderness buyers can always go for the 260-hp Outback Wilderness.\n\nAll-terrain tires are a given on the new Forester Wilderness, as is an X-Mode terrain assist feature with at least two modes. In the past, Subaru included a full-size spare tire, strengthened roof rails, stain-resistant seats, and a front-view camera.\n\nOff road, the Crosstrek Wilderness has impressed us , and we have high expectations for the 2025 Forester Wilderness. That said, the larger Forester must also answer to practical, compact-SUV basics in addition to Wilderness off-roading capability. Like every Wilderness model, the 2025 Forester will take the SUV's look to the next level -- and likely serve as a big reason some buy it.\n\nPricing for the 2025 Forester Wilderness may start around $37,000 if Subaru sticks with the non-hybrid engine. That would place the trim above the Sport but below the more premium Limited and Touring models.",

SWET's mission is to conduct interdisciplinary research at the interface of sport and wellness, developing strategies to increase access and performance.\n\nUnder Professor Sharhidd Taliep's leadership, the group addresses disparities in sport, wellness, and excellence by promoting community transformation through equitable access and education.\n\nThe team's expertise spans key areas, including equitable sport participation, physical activity and well-being, sport technology integration, community transformation, education and capacity building, policy advocacy, and youth development.\n\nOur Approach\n\nSport and physical education in South Africa face significant challenges, particularly in underserved communities. Barriers such as unequal access to facilities, coaching, and technology, along with cultural and gender stereotypes, hinder participation.\n\nWe address these challenges by developing sustainable pathways for sport and physical activity that promote wellness, excellence, and inclusivity among underrepresented groups. Technology plays a crucial role in bridging these gaps, creating new opportunities for all South Africans.\n\nOur Research\n\nOur research focuses on three key areas: Access, Excellence, and Wellness. We explore critical questions and strategies to promote sustainable, inclusive participation, with a focus on underserved communities.\n\n[adding a small relevant graphic to each area - access, excellence, wellness - would be great]\n\nAccess: We aim to ensure sport participation and physical activity opportunities for all communities\n\nExcellence: We seek to enhance sporting and physical fitness across all communities\n\nWellness: We focus on leveraging sport and physical activity to improve the well-being of South Africans at all life stages.\n\n[insert banners below to help break up text-heavy areas]\n\nPopular Newspaper Articles\n\nPartner with Us\n\nWe invite you to join us in our mission to promote equitable sport participation and excellence across South Africa.\n\nProf Sharhidd Taliep\n\nSport Excellence and Equity Research Group\n\nCape Peninsula University of Technology\n\nEmail: TaliepS@cput.ac.za\n\n3 Floor, The Wicket Building, Newlands Cricket Ground, 146 Campground Road, Newlands 7700, Cape Town, South Africa.",

        "body": "Experts, advisors and investors give their views on the state of sports technology in 2025 and offer insight into the funding outlook and political headwinds for the next 12 months.\n\nThe sports tech ecosystem has never been as diverse, innovative or as essential as it is now. Technology is no longer a sideshow to the main event or a sunk cost that must be tolerated by executives, coaches, and players. It is an intrinsic part of sport and a powerful driver of commercial revenue and on-field performance.\n\nIn an industry where marginal gains can be the difference between victory and defeat, technology is a key differentiator on and off the field.\n\nSupporting this transformation is a new wave of sports-specific vendors developing products, platforms and applications designed to solve sports-specific challenges and opportunities. These innovations target everything from athletic performance, injury prevention and recruitment through to business operations, ecommerce and fan engagement.\n\nThe annual list of 20 sports technology ideas to invest in now profiles many of these exiting new companies. To coincide with the launch of each edition, SportsPro also talks to a panel of experts, advisors and investors to find out which trends, opportunities and challenges the industry should be aware of for the year ahead.\n\nThe contributors:\n\nWhat trends will define sports technology in 2025?\n\nRohn Malhotra: At grassroots and recreational levels, sports-specific wearables will finally find their market - especially in football. [Meanwhile] two thirds of sports technology investments in 2024 involved fan experiences and I expect that trend to continue, whether it's immersive mega screens, smart ticketing or enhanced reality, as opposed to virtual reality (VR), which is something quite different and still some time away.\n\nFor executives it will be about broadcast technology, specifically altcasts like the ones we've seen between the National Football League (NFL) and The Simpsons, the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Disney and, more recently, the Australian Open's animated streams for YouTube. These create multiple revenue opportunities, from an entirely new rights category to new sponsorship avenues.\n\nJenna Kurath: 2025 will be defined by a powerful convergence of AI, immersive experiences and advanced data analytics that will impact how sports are played, watched and monetised. For example, I'm seeing AI being used to power real-time language translation in video production, which can help break down geographical barriers and expand global fanbases for everything from youth sports to emerging new sports leagues.\n\nI expect brands, venues, and teams will look to continue to deliver a customised fan experience at home and in the stadium by leveraging advanced social media insights, smart venue navigation, and immersive viewing technologies that can transport fans into the heart of the action, wherever they are located. At the same time, I think that contextual 'shoppable moments' that can power modern ecommerce integrations to turn broadcasts into interactive marketplaces will become more common.\n\nWe're also seeing companies starting to use dynamic ad insertion to deliver hyper-relevant advertising, which creates a more engaging experience for viewers and can unlock new revenue streams for sports organisations. And on the field, advanced bio-analytics can provide athletes with personalised insights to optimise performance and minimise injury. In my opinion, these trends signal a future where technology not only enhances but fundamentally reshapes the landscape of sport.\n\nJean-Baptiste Alliot: After several years of accelerated technological breakthroughs, we now find ourselves at the cusp of a more mature yet equally transformative phase. The excitement surrounding innovation has evolved, giving way to a deeper focus on integration and consolidations for sustainable growth. In addition, technologies such as AI, blockchain, and smart infrastructure have moved beyond proof-of-concept and are now embedded in long-term strategic plans, driven by their ability to enhance both operational efficiency and fan engagement.\n\nThis is an opportunity for sports organisations to leverage new capabilities, to truly achieve long-promised impacts like fan personalisation and immersive sports. At the same time, this evolution challenges them to ensure they remain up to date with the latest developments and their operational tech stack they have started to build over the past months, years. As we can see, this technological momentum is not without its complexities. In this context, success will also belong to those who can harness the power of emerging technologies while maintaining the trust and loyalty of their stakeholders, through strong ethical and governance considerations.\n\nCiCi Bellis: Sports technology will be defined by increasingly sophisticated data analytics, the expanded use of AI and immersive fan experiences. Wearables and sensor-enabled equipment will become more precise, tracking real-time biometric, performance and movement data that coaches and athletes can leverage. AI will transform this raw data into targeted insights, optimising training regimes and strategies. Meanwhile, new fan engagement technologies will enable interactive, personalised viewing experiences that transform traditional broadcasts into immersive events.\n\nMohit Pareek: AI has already made its presence felt in sport, but 2025 will see it have a greater impact across fan engagement and athlete performance. We've already seen major properties such as Wimbledon use generative AI tools and we will see more personalised fan experiences through the greater use of AI tools and automated storytelling.\n\nCosm's immersive 'shared reality' facilities are seen by many as the future of remote viewing (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nWhich sector within sports tech will see the greatest growth over the next 12 months?\n\nMP: There were more than US$4.4 billion of private placements in sports technology during 2024 and roughly 25 per cent of that went into the fan engagement space. We are very bullish about that segment in 2025 as well as the youth sports category which now has strong platforms, is ripe for consolidation and greater capital infusion.\n\nJBA: Growth will happen off the pitch. The on-pitch [segment] is too small and niche to generate the greatest proportion of growth, despite its significant impact. Specifically, growth will involve existing technology or new products and services leveraging AI to deliver better, faster services at a lower cost. AI will enhance everything from content and multilingual accessibility through to scouting, personalisation and fan engagement.\n\nThere are other areas we see driving growth. Tech stacks will become more consolidated and streamlined to simplify operations and drive efficiency. Success will come from selecting tailored solutions that meet specific needs, reducing downtime and improving integration.\n\nMedia-tech convergence will also have an impact as the line between sports organisations continues to blur, while there will be significant investments in immersive experience technologies such as 3D data rendering or shared reality, with companies like Cosm leading the way.\n\nThese trends underscore a common thread: the organisations that thrive in 2025 will be those that embrace strategic tech adoption, streamline their operations, and adapt to shifting market demands, transforming challenges into growth opportunities.\n\nCB: Digital fan engagement platforms are poised for fast growth. Fans are seeking new ways to connect and personalise their experiences, and these platforms offer live chat features, predictive analytics for fantasy sports, behind-the-scenes content, loyalty features and rewards. As more leagues and teams look to create direct relationships with their audiences and understand them better, innovative engagement solutions will see rapid adoption.\n\nRM: The media rights landscape is arguably sport's biggest challenge and therefore, opportunity. Tech that can deliver truly innovative broadcast experiences, which will be in high demand as everyone - from rights holders to broadcasters - is looking for a way to help their product stand out.\n\nJK: Fan engagement solutions that directly generate revenue, both in venues and during broadcasts, are likely to see remarkable growth. This includes technologies like immersive LED displays, augmented and virtual reality experiences, advanced camera systems with unique broadcast angles, real-time data analytics to power personalised content and offers, and in-seat offerings that facilitate mobile ordering, betting, and interactive content delivery.\n\nSeveral tech platforms helping college athlete monetise their NIL have emerged in recent years (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nWhat's the most overhyped sports tech trend or product heading into 2025?\n\nCB: NIL (name, image, and likeness) monetisation platforms marketed to college athletic departments are likely an overhyped phenomenon for 2025.\n\nWhile these systems promise to streamline deals, ensure compliance, and expand athletes' personal brands, the reality is often far more complex. The patchwork of state regulations, NCAA guidelines, and varying institutional policies creates significant roadblocks to seamless adoption. Also, many student-athletes and their schools lack the resources or know-how to fully leverage these platforms, leading to inconsistent engagement and minimal ROI.\n\nUntil a clear, standardised framework emerges and these platforms demonstrate tangible long-term benefits, the hype around NIL tech tools is likely to outstrip their actual impact.\n\nRM: First a general take: while AI dominates most conversations, few companies actually implement true self-learning algorithms. It's important to look past the buzzwords. AI isn't overhyped, but it is overused and often incorrectly labelled.\n\nSpecifically in sports, injury prevention has become a marketing catchphrase. Many products make bold claims about protecting elite athletes, but these rarely have scientific validation or proven adoption by professional teams. While professional sport is all about incremental gains, we're already seeing backlash against terms like 'load management', for example in the NBA.\n\nMP: Collectible sport non-fungible tokens (NFTs) do not seem to be gaining significant traction with fans. For example, Tom Brady's NFT startup Autograph, which had raised US$200 million, recently underwent a major pivot away from its original vision of selling collectible sports NFTs.\n\nDonald Trump's impact on the sporting and technology worlds could be significant (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nWill political or macroeconomic changes have an impact on funding this year?\n\nJBA: Trump's arrival may provide bigger capital and equity flow into tech, with fewer regulations to be expected around AI and the tech sector at large. Private equity and venture capital (VC) firms may anticipate more pro-business approaches to be implemented by the newly elected president, which could have a positive impact on capital. However, the impact may be more felt in 2026 rather than in 2025 as funding has still proved hard to secure in the early part of the year.\n\nHowever, the changing commercial relationship between North America and the rest of the world will have an impact if it leads to tougher trade conditions and a less business-friendly approach. Europe is preparing itself to be less dependent on the US when it comes to tech and it is expected that several funding schemes to support the sector will be announced in February.\n\nNonetheless, North America and the US will remain the main market by far when it comes to funding - in sports tech and across all business areas. And it will also probably become one of the most pro-business countries, attracting many tech companies to establish themselves in America.\n\nMP: The new Trump administration has signalled it will be much more friendly towards the markets and we believe this will improve investor confidence and sports tech will also benefit from this. January has already been a record month for sports tech funding (more than US$3.9 billion) and we expect 2025 to be a very strong year.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration intends to implement new tariffs, which will likely increase costs for companies that manufacture physical products. This could make investors more hesitant to invest in sports tech companies that provide sports equipment or electronic hardware.\n\nCB: Adjusting interest rates and inflation encourage venture capitalists to seek out the most promising and resilient startups, leading to more strategic investments. Additionally, government policy changes - such as those related to data privacy, sports betting regulations, or international trade agreements - can either constrain or expand the scope of new ventures. As for 2025, I am bullish on the IPO market and M&A opening back up, and the effects to waterfall down to early-stage venture investing.\n\nRM: Very few businesses succeed in chaos and sport isn't one of them. Sport needs economic stability to thrive, whether for fans buying tickets or VCs backing startups. We've seen numerous announcements of new sports tech funds, but little capital has hit the market in the last 18 months, primarily because of the overarching cautious sentiment. The dry powder is primed - and shifting political tides could be the spark that ignites it.\n\nStartups will need access to funding and support, say experts l(Image credit: Respo.vision)\n\nWhat support can governments and regulators give entrepreneurs and sports tech startups in 2025?\n\nCB: Governments and regulators can support by providing funding opportunities through grants, tax incentives, and research initiatives. They can also create innovation-friendly regulatory environments that encourage experimentation and development while ensuring ethical and responsible technology use. Collaboration between governments, sports organisations, and tech companies can create ecosystems that nurture startups, promote knowledge sharing, and accelerate the growth of the sports tech sector.\n\nJBA: This needs to be more than just 2025. [Sports tech firms] need a long-term vision and a clear framework within which they know they can operate over the coming years. Entrepreneurs and startups would like more funding support and reduced taxes to be more competitive and to have greater financial means to invest in product development and business growth.\n\nThis clarity will be crucial given the uncertainties that Trump's re-election brings to the political and economic environments. Paperwork simplification, tax levels, and the public funding and schemes available all matter to entrepreneurs. Additionally, how European governments and regulators react to potential decisions from Washington will be crucial to ensure Europe isn't left behind.\n\nRM: Early-stage companies need government support to make their lives easier, either in the form of access to capital or through initiatives that promote innovation and foster collaboration. Later-stage companies need regulators not to make their lives difficult, allowing businesses to grow without unreasonable encumbrances. Regulation can of course create huge opportunities - see sports betting in the US - but that is less common than one would like.\n\nMP: Sports betting has huge potential and it has started to gain more traction in the US market as regulatory frameworks are changing. The industry could see a major boost from more state governments lifting bans, especially California and Texas, which are the two most populous US states but still have restrictions in place.\n\nSportsPro New York 2025 will tackle challenges and uncover opportunities in the largest sports media market in the world.

        "body": "I am somewhat cynical when it comes to a lot of marketing -- especially things like sponsoring sports teams or buying naming rights for stadiums. There is brand exposure for sure, but in my opinion, these things generally have more to do with the ego or the personal hobbies and interests of company leadership than actually moving the needle on marketing.\n\nReliaQuest is different to me because they are not just putting their name on a college bowl game as a vanity play. They are also using the relationship to elevate cybersecurity awareness and taking action to address the escalating need for skilled cybersecurity professionals with its launch of a two-day Cyber Lab Bootcamp across universities participating in the ReliaQuest Bowl.\n\nThis innovative program bridges the gap between classroom learning and real-world application, offering students hands-on, immersive experiences that are pivotal for their professional growth. I sat down with Clifford Henderson, Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Alabama -- one of the two universities that competed in this year's ReliaQuest Bowl, to talk about the Cyber Lab Bootcamp program.\n\nThe cybersecurity sector faces a critical talent shortage. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts a 35% growth in demand for information security analysts through 2031, far outpacing the average for other professions.\n\nThe reality is that there is no shortage of people eager to learn and excel in cybersecurity. The onus is on the cybersecurity industry to provide the training and opportunities to make that possible.\n\nThis perspective emphasizes the importance of partnerships between industry and academia to build a strong pipeline of cybersecurity talent, ensuring the industry remains resilient in the face of evolving threats.\n\nHenderson underscores the importance of this partnership, stating, \"You always have to ask, what are you hoping to get out of it, right, with whatever audience you're reaching? For us, this program is an incredible way to expose students to cybersecurity career paths they might not have considered before.\"\n\nReliaQuest, a global cybersecurity company that offers an AI-driven security operations platform based in Florida, has long prioritized cybersecurity education. Over the past decade, its ReliaQuest Labs program has provided students with the chance to engage in real-world cybersecurity challenges and technologies. Conducted in partnership with the University of South Florida (USF), the program has successfully prepared over 350 graduates, many of whom have gone on to join the company. Building on this foundation, the Cyber Lab Bootcamp condenses the essence of this program into a dynamic two-day experience.\n\nBy integrating the bootcamp into the ReliaQuest Bowl, the company is leveraging the event's visibility to inspire students and highlight the importance of cybersecurity careers. This approach not only raises awareness but also positions ReliaQuest as a leader in addressing the talent gap.\n\nPairing the Cyber Lab Bootcamp with the ReliaQuest Bowl is a masterstroke in reaching a diverse and engaged audience. Sporting events bring together students, alumni, and fans, creating a unique platform to showcase the role of cybersecurity in everyday life. By demonstrating how technology intersects with sports, the company is inspiring students who may never have considered a career in cybersecurity to explore this dynamic field.\n\nThis innovative blend of sports and technology highlights how seemingly unrelated industries can collaborate to address pressing challenges. The approach serves as a model for other sectors seeking to expand workforce opportunities while capturing public attention.\n\nAs Henderson explains, \"We see companies marketing to students all the time, but very few engage in a way that directly benefits students' futures. ReliaQuest is using the bowl game as a gateway to introduce cybersecurity as a career path to students who might not have otherwise been exposed to it.\"\n\nA standout feature of the Cyber Lab Bootcamp is its mentorship component. Students gain invaluable insights by working directly with seasoned cybersecurity professionals. This hands-on guidance accelerates learning, builds confidence, and establishes vital connections that can shape their career paths.\n\nReliaQuest's track record with mentorship through its full-length labs program underscores the power of this approach. Many participants credit their mentors with helping them refine their skills and transition smoothly into professional roles. Embedding mentorship into the bootcamp ensures students receive a holistic learning experience that extends beyond technical expertise.\n\nThe Cyber Lab Bootcamp is part of a broader, long-term strategy to close the cybersecurity talent gap. ReliaQuest is committed to sustained innovation in training programs and advocacy efforts to encourage diverse participation in cybersecurity. The company actively supports initiatives aimed at increasing representation from underrepresented groups, reinforcing that inclusivity and collaboration are key to solving the industry's challenges.\n\nReliaQuest's partnership with the ReliaQuest Bowl amplifies the reach and impact of its educational initiatives. By aligning the bootcamp with a high-profile event, the company engages students from varied academic backgrounds, encouraging exploration of cybersecurity careers. This strategy not only broadens the talent pool but also reinforces the critical role cybersecurity plays in today's interconnected world.\n\nThe success of ReliaQuest Labs at USF provides a blueprint for the Cyber Lab Bootcamp's potential impact. Alumni of the program consistently praise its ability to bridge the gap between theory and practice, preparing them for real-world challenges. Many have transitioned seamlessly into roles at ReliaQuest, contributing to its mission of safeguarding global cybersecurity.\n\nLooking ahead, ReliaQuest envisions refining and expanding the bootcamp model. Future iterations may include deeper dives into specialized areas, virtual components for broader accessibility, and additional partnerships with educational institutions. These enhancements aim to create a lasting ripple effect, inspiring other organizations to adopt similar models to tackle the global talent shortage.\n\nReliaQuest's Cyber Lab Bootcamp exemplifies how private organizations can drive meaningful change in workforce development. By combining immersive training, mentorship, and the visibility of the ReliaQuest Bowl, the company is setting a new standard for industry-led educational initiatives.\n\n\"I think we look at these kind of programs, you know, as a real win for both sides. It's great for our students,\" summed up Henderson. \"It's one thing to just come in and teach material, but it's another thing to also talk about the career, and what all the different options and paths are.\"\n\nAs cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, programs like the Cyber Lab Bootcamp will play a vital role in equipping the next generation of professionals to meet these challenges head-on and lay the foundation for a safer, more resilient digital future.",

        "title": "INCOMPARABLE INDULGENCE ON- AND OFF-ROAD: 2025 LEXUS LX 700h",
        "body": "Lexus' flagship SUV adds a hybrid powertrain, equipped with 3.4L twin-turbo V6 Overtrail grade available exclusively on LX 700h with two or three-rows Lexus Safety System+ 3.0 now standard across the LX lineup Starting MSRP of $106,850 (includes Delivery, Processing and Handling Fee)\n\nPLANO, Texas, Feb. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- For customers seeking a paradigm of performance and an adventure-ready SUV, the wait is finally over. The 2025 Lexus LX has arrived with pure power, superior on-road agility, and heightened off-road capability and confidence.\n\nSince its launch in 1995, the Lexus LX has served as the brand's definitive statement of flagship luxury. For 2025, the SUV takes luxury to even greater heights with improvements to the LX 600 and the addition of the first-ever LX 700h.\n\nThe 2025 LX is offered in five grades: Premium, F SPORT Handling, Luxury, Ultra Luxury, and -- new for this year -- Overtrail. This makes the LX the only vehicle in the Lexus lineup to offer both F SPORT and Overtrail.\n\nFor a full breakdown of the standard and available features by grade, please see the LX Specifications.\n\nLexus Overtrail Project\n\nAt the 2023 Tokyo Outdoor Show, Lexus introduced the \"Overtrail Project,\" an initiative that intends to inspire customers around the world to explore nature through refined adventures. The goal is to include more opportunities for Lexus customers in the future, including potential products, accessories, gear, and experiences. The addition of Overtrail as an available grade on the LX 700h falls under the umbrella of this initiative.\n\nOvertrail Emboldens Off-Road Discovery\n\nBuilding on the renowned off-road prowess of the LX, the Overtrail grade offers additional features and equipment to help customers revel in the exploration of the outdoors. It exudes a tough and rugged persona too: offering exterior color Earth1 and, inside, Black or Stone Brown semi-aniline leather-trim on the seats and door panels with Stone Brown stitching and Black Open Pore wood accents on the center console and door panels.\n\nIn addition, Overtrail adds front and rear locking differentials, a 2,400W AC inverter, and off-road all-weather floor liners. The vehicle is adorned with 33-inch All-Terrain tires and 18-inch wheels, a front skid plate, and an appearance package, featuring a matte gray grille, black door handles, dark gray roof rails, dark chrome-finished window and bumper trim, and black overfenders.\n\nThe Overtrail grade is available on the LX 700h and can be equipped as a two or three-row configuration.\n\n1\n\nPreviously seen on the 2024 Lexus GX\n\nGA-F Platform\n\nThe 2025 LX 600 and 700h sit on the GA-F platform, which was introduced in 2022. To accommodate the weight and extended length of the LX 700h, a new three-cross frame is used on the new model. A new spare tire cross has been designed to reposition the spare tire in order to facilitate the installation of the hybrid main battery in the rear floor. This adjustment optimizes the mounting angle, lowering the installation position while maintaining the departure angle, thereby balancing off-road capability with serviceability.\n\nIn addition, the platform increases body rigidity and improves on-road handling, key elements of Lexus Driving Signature (LDS). For 2025, Lexus has evolved LDS fundamentals and specifically tuned the LX to enable a linear response to steering inputs and preserve wheel articulation without compromising the LX's off-road performance.\n\nThe cab mount cushions attaching the body to the frame have been completely redesigned. By strengthening the joint rigidity during frame and body twisting, low-frequency vibrations have been significantly reduced. This enhancement maintains the vehicle's inherent advantages, such as high durability and excellent road noise insulation, while delivering a responsive and more refined ride.\n\nA double-wishbone front suspension is paired with a multi-link rear suspension to achieve both a high level of off-road driving performance and on-road prowess.\n\nA Powertrain to Fit Every Adventure\n\nReady for the adventure ahead, both the LX 600 and LX 700h can tow up to 8,000 pounds.\n\nLX-First Hybrid Powertrain\n\nWith the introduction of the LX 700h, Lexus now offers 12 electrified models across the lineup to meet the diverse needs of luxury customers. Customer choice is at the heart of its multi-pathway approach to carbon reduction.\n\nPowered by a nickel-metal hydride battery, the LX 700h offers a responsive and highly capable twin-turbocharged 3.4-liter V6 engine paired with a 10-speed Direct Shift Automatic Transmission (same as the LX 600). The hybrid system produces 457 horsepower, 583 lb.-ft of torque, and an improved EPA-estimated combined fuel economy rating of 20 MPG. The twin turbochargers deliver steady and consistent acceleration to easily control power delivery in both on and off-road scenarios. The battery is located under the luggage compartment for two-row configurations, and beneath the third-row seat for three-row configurations. This is the first Lexus hybrid system to feature both an alternator and a starter as standard components, a departure from previous hybrid models for the brand. In the event the hybrid system is inoperative, the starter enables independent engine ignition, while the alternator powers the 12V auxiliary battery, allowing the vehicle to continue driving using only the engine.\n\nIn off-road conditions, the vehicle expands its capabilities beyond high range by adding motor-driven power to the low range for the first time in a Lexus. This feature, in conjunction with the various modes of Multi-Terrain Select, enables motor-only driving in scenarios requiring precise throttle control, such as rocky paths, dirt roads, and deep snow, helping to achieve exceptional off-road performance and ease of handling.\n\nThe LX 700h features a waterproof structure that encases the hybrid main battery within a waterproof tray divided into upper and lower sections. This design helps prevent water ingress during deep water crossings, ensuring a fording capability of 27.5 inches. In the unlikely event that water does enter the tray, a water sensor positioned inside will detect it and alert the driver through a meter display.\n\nPowering the LX 600\n\nThe 3.4-liter V6 twin-turbo gasoline engine (V35A-FTS engine) in the LX 600 produces an output of 409 horsepower and maximum 479 lb.-ft. of torque. The vehicle maintains maximum torque in a wide range up to 3,600 rpm, making it easier to handle not only during on-road driving but also during off-road driving, which can require frequent use in the low-speed range.\n\n10-Speed Direct Shift Automatic Transmission\n\nAcross the LX lineup, the 10-speed Direct Shift Automatic Transmission produces a smooth start that only a torque converter can provide, as well as manual transmission-like direct acceleration by activating lockup in almost its entire range of operation (except when the vehicle starts from a stop). The cross gear ratio setting - which brings the gear ratios of each stage closer together - and the quick gear shift time make for crisp gear shifting at regular intervals, creating a driving rhythm that is in harmony with the sound of the engine.\n\nA wide range of gear ratios is employed for strong starting comfort as well as high-speed driving. The low first gear increases the driving force when starting at low speeds, providing a smooth start and powerful low speed off-road driving performance.\n\nAn oil pan guard is installed to the lower body of the automatic transmission, which has been designed for off-road performance, to help reduce the risk of oil pan damage due to unplanned hits to the underfloor that might occur when conquering rocky roads.\n\nUncompromising Performance\n\nLexus' flagship SUV has been known for its compelling blend of luxury, power, and rugged capability -- the 2025 LX models continue that legacy.\n\nCritical for off-road activities, the Torsen® limited-slip locking center differential is standard on all LX models, evenly splitting the engine's power 50:50 to help provide exceptional control in low grip situations and help prevent excess wheel spin. When accelerating during a turn, the differential optimally distributes the driving force according to the load on the rear left and right wheels to achieve controlled performance. In straight-line driving, it responds well to changes in road conditions, contributing to overall vehicle stability.\n\nOn the LX 700h, the Overtrail grade adds an electronically controlled front and rear locking differential, which enables the driver to lock as needed to improve the vehicle's wheel stability and traction over rough terrain.\n\nThe following systems are standard across the 2025 LX Lineup:\n\nActive Height Control (AHC) and Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS): To ensure a seamless balance between off-road drivability and on-road handling stability, the LX utilizes AHC and AVS - both now standard across the LX lineup. This system provides improved grip, traction, and control as well as a sense of strength and security. The valve structure of the AVS actuator has been redesigned to smoothly control dampening force when the absorber compresses rapidly, such as when driving over bumps, resulting in a smoother ride with reduced jolts. Additionally, in the low range, dampening force control has been improved during deceleration from extremely low speeds to a stop, minimizing unnecessary vehicle movement and enhancing both comfort and confidence when driving over rough terrain.\n\nMulti-Terrain Select (MTS): With MTS, the driver can switch between high range (H4) and low range (L4) to provide optimized drive power, hydraulic brake pressure, and suspension control according to the selected mode. L4 has four modes: Auto, Sand, Mud and Rock. H4 has five modes: Auto, Dirt, Sand, Mud and Deep Snow. The Auto mode uses information from various sensors to estimate the road conditions while driving to maintain ideal performance in various driving conditions, without having to switch modes.\n\nMulti-Terrain Monitor (MTM): When MTS is on, the MTM is engaged to assist the driver with increased visibility under and around the vehicle when driving off-road. The MTM uses four cameras within the Panoramic View Monitor System (PVM) to transpose underfloor, front, side and rear-view camera images shown to the 12.3-inch display, allowing the driver to check road conditions, blind spots and distance between obstacles.\n\nElectric Power Steering (EPS) and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB): EPS uses the motor and reduction gear instead of conventional hydraulics. At low speeds, the light steering sensation contributes to reducing driver burden, and at high speeds, a moderate steering force in line with the vehicle's speed provides a driving experience that is distinctive of the Lexus Driving Signature. ECB employs a sensor to detect the degree of brake pedal depression and creates braking force with the hydraulic brakes for more linear braking characteristics. When MTS is selected for off-road driving, the system is designed to ensure a high level of driving stability through detailed braking control to counter slipping or spinning wheels.\n\nCrawl Control with Turn Assist: Engaged when the vehicle is in low range, Crawl Control allows the LX to move forward or in reverse at one of five driver-selected low-speed settings: LO, MIDL, MID, MIDH and HIGH. Crawl Control intuitively orchestrates the engagement and disengagement of engine output and hydraulic braking pressure to help reduce tire slippage and optimize chassis behavior. Turn Assist tightens the vehicle's turning circle by adding brake force to the inside rear wheel.\n\nDownhill Assist Control: When descending a steep slope, the system is designed to automatically control the hydraulic pressure of the brakes on all four wheels to support stable descent without locking the wheels. Because the selected vehicle speed is maintained through the operation of a switch, the driver can concentrate on steering operations without worrying about braking and accelerating, thus reducing the burden on the driver.\n\nDrive Mode Select: Using the Drive Mode Select switch on the center console, the driver is able to choose from a variety of modes to customize the vehicle's performance and steering characteristics. Featured modes include Normal, ECO, Comfort, Custom, Sport S, and Sport S+.\n\nTurning Heads On and Off-Road\n\nDesigned under the notion of \"Dignified Sophistication\", the Lexus LX marries superior function with stunning aesthetic. The front A-pillars are pulled rearward to create a cab-backward design and a stout torso helps to express a dynamic driving image. For its spindle grille, a three-dimensional shape comprised of seven sets of floating bars creates a seamless and frame-free structure. It is style rooted in function: fine-tuning the thickness of each bar to the millimeter provides the high-level cooling performance required for the twin-turbo engine. The side radiator grilles also have large openings to ensure cooling performance and are shaped to provide a high-level rectifying effect.\n\nFor the headlamps, the L-shaped clearance lamps (with daytime running lamp function) have a three-dimensional shape, and their inner lenses are doubled, with each having a different level to give a sense of depth and change depending on the viewing angle.\n\nThe sides portray a strong sense of unity and mass, with a thick, horizontal torso running the entirety of the profile, blending through to the muscular rear wheel arches. The LX's quarter pillars narrow from the roof to the back window, while a distinct chiseled flow from the underside of the vehicle runs up from the lower edge of the rocker panels to behind the rear tires. For 2025, a full-size spare tire is standard across the LX lineup.\n\nFor the rear combination lamps, tail lamps have been adopted that combine an L-shape and a continuous axial flow from the front to the shoulders and then to the rear silhouette.\n\nDepending on the grade, the LX is offered in seven exterior color options: Eminent White Pearl*, Atomic Silver, Manganese Luster*, Nori Green Pearl, Caviar, Ultra White, and Earth.\n\n*\n\nAvailable for an additional charge\n\nF SPORT Handling\n\nGuests preferring a sportier look and feel can select the F SPORT Handling grade. Styling features of the F SPORT Handling grade include exclusive 22-inch forged aluminum wheels and an F mesh design spindle grille with jet-black chrome grille frame.\n\nFor performance, the F SPORT Handling grade features uniquely tuned standard front and rear performance dampers, a Torsen® LSD and a rear stabilizer. Special tuning of the EPS and AVS offers performance focused response and handling stability that only the F SPORT Handling can provide.\n\nAn Interior Worth Indulging In\n\nThe LX is the definitive chapter of flagship luxury - providing the signature refined comfort, luxurious interior elements, and usability customers expect in a Lexus. The driver-focused cockpit design instills confidence and control with all essential controls and information (e.g., gauges, standard Head-Up Display, meters, etc.) within the driver's reach and forward sightline. With the adoption of the electroshiftmatic system, the first for a Lexus off-road four-wheel drive vehicle, the brand focused on enhancing ease of operation and grip during maneuvers specific to rough terrain. This has led to the introduction of a new shift knob with excellent usability.\n\nFor 2025, the LX lineup offers five massage options for the driver and front passenger seats when equipped with semi-aniline leather trim. Whether a customer is looking for a full body massage or targeting a specific area, the intensity can be adjusted across five different levels for an indulgent and customized experience.\n\nFrom available power fold-flat third-row seating to automated seating configurations that offer more space for spontaneity, the LX offers the adventurer everything but compromise. The front seats of the LX are designed to minimize fatigue by providing optimum support to support the occupant's back while the shape of the lumbar area and side bolsters enable free range of arm motion. A 60:40 split-folding second-row rear seat is standard on LX 600 and 700h models. A one-motion tumble system is featured for convenient access to the third row/luggage space. For LX models equipped with a third row, power-folding rear seats are split 50:50.\n\nA unique shelf system has been added in the cargo space of the LX 700h with fold-flat capability due to the placement of the battery. For additional convenience on the LX 700h, a center console cool box and rear manual sunshades have been added as standard features.\n\nThe LX 700h is equipped with a waterproof AC inverter positioned under the center console, allowing for external power supply of up to 2400W. The LX 600 features a power supply of 120V/100W in the rear deck. To enhance user convenience, USB Type-C power outlets have been installed at the rear of the center console and in the rear deck.\n\nDepending on grade, the LX is offered in five interior color options: Palomino, White/Peppercorn, Circuit Red, Black, and Stone Brown. The LX is also offered in four interior trim finishes, depending on grade: Brown Open-Pore Wood, Black Open-Pore Wood, Hadori Aluminum, and Takanoha Wood.\n\nThe LX comes standard with a 10-speaker premium surround system with available 25-speaker Mark Levinson® Surround Sound.\n\nF SPORT Handling\n\nIn the F SPORT Handling grade, the heated steering wheel and shifter are wrapped with textured genuine leather for great style and grip, and the exclusive F SPORT emblem is applied throughout. Uniquely designed F SPORT crafted seats and embossed headrests further enhance hold against lateral G-forces. Ultra White (exterior) with Circuit Red (interior) are offered as an F SPORT Handling grade exclusive.\n\nUltra Luxury\n\nThe four-seat Ultra Luxury grade enhances the LX lineup with special attention paid to the rear passenger space and their experience. The rear seats feature Ultra Luxury-exclusive curved headrests, seatbacks and cushions that gently wrap around the head, hips and lower body. The crafted VIP seating helps to offset any lateral G-forces and irregular road surfaces. The seats are shaped to help maintain a secure posture, while the use of soft urethane with superior vibration absorption performance helps to suppress unwanted movement - even in off-road driving conditions.\n\nIn the second row, the rear control panel centrally manages the rear passenger experience through audio, climate, seat adjustment, and lighting controls. For passengers looking to recharge for the journey ahead, a wireless charging space is provided.\n\nAdded comfort features such as sunshades on the side and quarter windows, reading lights, and a rear seat display are standard. An Ultra Luxury grade exclusive air conditioning system offers unique overhead ceiling vents for a full body comfort breeze experience. For 2025, a front wireless charger is now standard.\n\nTechnology and Convenience Features\n\nLexus Interface with 12.3-inch touchscreen\n\nA standard 12.3-inch high-definition upper touchscreen with added LX-exclusive 7-inch lower touchscreen, provides easy-to-use controls and clear information to the driver and front-seat passenger.

See lexus.com/interface for details.\n\nFront Cross-Traffic Alert (Standard)\n\nDesigned to warn the driver of the presence of crossing vehicles or bicyclists at intersections, thereby potentially reducing the severity of, or preventing some intersection collisions.\n\nHead-Up Display (Now standard)\n\nEssential information such as a speedometer and shift position, and other information including navigational directions, and the information displayed during the use of Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, Lane Tracing Assist, and Road Sign Assist can be safely displayed in front of the driver's field of vision. The display's positioning can be linked to a driver's seat position memory function.\n\nMark Levinson® Surround Sound (Available)\n\nThe available 25-speaker Mark Levinson Premium Surround Sound tuned for the LX's cabin delivers high-quality audio. The system incorporates Mark Levinson QLS (Quantum Logic Surround) sound technology to provide stage-like, full-bodied, balanced tones to all passengers regardless of seating position.\n\nAdvanced Park with Remote Park (LX 700h only)\n\nThe intuitive driver's aid system can help in various maneuvers, such as when perpendicular parking/exiting and parallel parking/exiting. Four Parallel View Monitor (PVM) cameras and 12 ultrasonic sensors provide visual data to support the automatic control of steering, accelerator, brake, and shift operations. Remote Park offers the added convenience of smartphone operation via the Lexus app. Lexus key fob required for use.\n\nSafe Exit Alert\n\nWhen exiting the luxury crossover, standard Safe Exit Alert is designed to detect a vehicle or bicycle approaching from the rear and help prevent the occupant from opening the door if it senses danger.\n\nLexus Safety System+ 3.0\n\nAll 2025 Lexus LX models now come standard with Lexus Safety System+ 3.0, which includes:\n\nPre-Collision System (PCS) with Pedestrian Detection\n\nPre-Collision System (PCS) with Pedestrian Detection is designed to help detect a vehicle, pedestrian, bicyclist or motorcyclist and provide an audio/visual forward collision warning under certain circumstances. If the driver does not react, the system is designed to provide automatic emergency braking at speeds between approximately 7-110 mph. PCS uses a camera and millimeter-wave radar for enhanced performance and reliability. Features for LSS+ 3.0 include:\n\nRisk Avoidance Emergency Steer Assist - designed to provide steering torque during an emergency maneuver initiated by the driver, enhancing vehicle stability and helping prevent lane departure. This steering support function is designed to operate when the Pre-Collision System is turned ON, the turn signal is not being operated, the speed of the vehicle is between 25-50 mph and the relative speed to the detected object is between 25-50 mph.\n\nLeft Turn Oncoming Vehicle Detection/Braking - designed to provide a warning and automatic braking if the system determines a driver is turning left in front of an oncoming vehicle in certain daytime conditions.\n\nAll-speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)\n\nAn adaptive cruise control system intended for highway use that uses radar and camera technology to help keep the vehicle at a preset speed and distance from vehicles ahead, even in stop-and-go traffic. If the system detects the vehicle getting closer than the preset distance, it automatically slows the vehicle -- even to a complete stop. At highway speeds, when the road ahead clears, the vehicle returns to its preset speed. For LSS+ 3.0, the new Curve Speed Management feature is added, which will aid to manage speed in curves when cruise control is engaged and may lower vehicle speed if needed.\n\nLane Tracing Assist (LTA)\n\nWhen Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC) is enabled and lane markers are detected, Lane Tracing Assist (LTA) uses the lines on the road and/or preceding vehicles to provide active driving assistance and help keep the vehicle centered in its lane.\n\nLane Departure Alert with Steering Assist (LDA w/SA) - When white/yellow lane markings or certain road edge boundary lines are detected at speeds above 30 mph, Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist (LDA w/SA) is designed to issue an audio/visual lane departure warning if an inadvertent lane departure is detected. If the driver does not take corrective action, the system is also designed to provide gentle corrective steering for lane keeping assistance.\n\nRoad Sign Assist (RSA) - Using an intelligent camera, Road Sign Assist (RSA) is designed to detect speed limit signs, stop signs, Do Not Enter signs, yield signs and certain warning signs, and display an icon of the sign on the Multi-Information Display (MID).\n\nIntelligent High Beams - This system provides greater visibility for drivers with added illumination when the road ahead is clear, then temporarily switches to low beams when it detects the headlamps or taillamps of vehicles ahead.\n\nProactive Driving Assist (PDA) - When system operating conditions are met, using the vehicle's camera and radar, Proactive Driving Assist (PDA) provides gentle braking into curves or gentle braking and/or steering to help support driving tasks such as distance control between the vehicle and a preceding vehicle, pedestrian or bicyclist.\n\nThe 2025 LX lineup is assembled at Toyota Auto Body Yoshiwara and is expected to arrive at dealerships in early 2025.\n\n2025 Lexus LX Pricing Chart\n\nModel #\n\nModel Name\n\n25MY MSRP*\n\n9621\n\nLX 600 Premium\n\n$106,850\n\n9622\n\nLX 600 F SPORT Handling\n\n$113,850\n\n9623\n\nLX 600 Luxury\n\n$115,850\n\n9626\n\nLX 700h Overtrail\n\n$115,350\n\n9627\n\nLX 700h F SPORT Handling\n\n$117,850\n\n9628\n\nLX 700h Luxury\n\n$119,850\n\n9629\n\nLX 700h Ultra Luxury\n\n$141,350\n\n*\n\nIncludes Delivery, Processing and Handling fee of $1,350\n\nAbout Lexus\n\nLexus' passion for brave design, imaginative technology, and exhilarating performance enables the luxury lifestyle brand to create amazing experiences for its customers.

        "title": "Saudi Arabia rising as a global mediator for peace - BLiTZ",
        "body": "In recent years, Saudi Arabia has undergone a transformation from being a predominantly oil-driven economy with significant regional influence to becoming a key player in global diplomacy. The Kingdom, once regarded primarily for its oil reserves and wealth, has steadily positioned itself as a potential global mediator and a stabilizing force, particularly within the Middle East. Its growing role on the international stage, particularly in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, highlights its newfound diplomatic power and its ability to facilitate dialogue in even the most complicated of global disputes.\n\nSaudi Arabia's emergence as a global mediator can be attributed to several interconnected factors: its strategic economic position, neutral diplomatic stance, significant investments in soft power, and increasing global partnerships. These elements not only make it an influential actor in global politics, but they also provide the Kingdom with the tools to foster peace and engage in meaningful international conflict resolution.\n\nAs the largest economy in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has long been a regional economic powerhouse. Its oil wealth, a critical resource in the global energy market, has provided the Kingdom with the financial means to influence global politics. The Kingdom's substantial financial capital enables it to contribute meaningfully to peace initiatives and humanitarian efforts across the world. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has also sought to diversify its economy through Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan that focuses on reducing the Kingdom's dependency on oil by developing sectors like technology, entertainment, and tourism. These economic reforms have enhanced the Kingdom's standing as an important global economic player.\n\nAdditionally, Saudi Arabia's significant investments in infrastructure, education, and youth development have further boosted its international presence. These efforts are laying the groundwork for a new, modernized image of the Kingdom-one that moves beyond its oil-based economy to become a leader in global innovation and development. With a burgeoning young population and a rapidly evolving domestic environment, Saudi Arabia is positioning itself as a nation not just of wealth but of forward-looking ambition.\n\nBeyond its economic might, Saudi Arabia has invested heavily in expanding its soft power. Sporting events like Formula 1 races, high-profile boxing matches, and the attraction of global football stars to its domestic Pro League have contributed to reshaping its international image. These high-profile events serve as an avenue for the Kingdom to connect with global audiences and enhance its cultural influence.\n\nTourism, too, has emerged as a crucial element in Saudi Arabia's push for a more approachable and relatable global image. With the launch of the \"Saudi Seasons\" initiative and significant investments in tourism infrastructure, millions of international visitors now flock to experience Saudi Arabia's rich historical and cultural heritage. This cultural openness has enhanced the Kingdom's international brand and provided a platform for soft diplomacy that reinforces its role as a rising global power.\n\nOne of Saudi Arabia's defining characteristics as a mediator in global conflicts is its diplomatic neutrality. The Kingdom has managed to maintain strong and functional relationships with a wide array of global powers. Its longstanding ties with the United States are complemented by a pragmatic, if complex, relationship with Russia. Saudi Arabia's interactions with China, the European Union, and many developing countries further demonstrate its ability to balance competing geopolitical interests.\n\nIt is precisely this neutrality that has made Saudi Arabia an attractive mediator in the ongoing Ukraine conflict. Unlike many Western countries, Saudi Arabia has refrained from imposing sanctions on Russia, thus maintaining open lines of communication with the Kremlin. At the same time, it has consistently expressed support for Ukraine's territorial integrity and provided humanitarian assistance to the war-torn country. This balanced approach has allowed Saudi Arabia to facilitate dialogue between Russia and Ukraine, leading to successful prisoner exchanges and other diplomatic breakthroughs.\n\nThe Kingdom's neutral stance in the Russia-Ukraine war is indicative of its broader diplomatic strategy. Saudi Arabia's position allows it to act as a bridge between conflicting parties, offering a neutral space for dialogue where trust can be built, and solutions can be explored. The ability to engage with both sides of a conflict without being seen as partisan is a rare and valuable asset in today's polarized global political landscape.\n\nAnother key aspect of Saudi Arabia's diplomatic influence is its leadership of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the world's second-largest intergovernmental body after the United Nations. As the chair of the OIC, Saudi Arabia wields significant influence in the Muslim world. The Kingdom's leadership role within this organization provides it with an additional platform to mediate regional conflicts and coordinate collective action on issues such as humanitarian crises, regional security, and religious tolerance.\n\nSaudi Arabia has used its position within the OIC to mediate conflicts and promote dialogue in areas like the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan, as well as the ongoing crisis in Yemen. In both cases, Saudi Arabia's leadership has helped bring about de-escalation and dialogue, further reinforcing its role as a diplomatic mediator. Additionally, its hosting of numerous peace talks and efforts to reduce hostilities in the Gulf region further underline the Kingdom's growing prominence as a peace broker.\n\nLooking ahead, Saudi Arabia's global influence is likely to continue expanding. Vision 2030, the Kingdom's ambitious plan to diversify its economy and foster innovation, aims to equip Saudi Arabia with the tools necessary to be a global leader in the 21st century. The plan prioritizes youth development, empowering women, and fostering technological advancements. These initiatives will not only make Saudi Arabia more resilient in the face of global economic shifts but will also position it as a key player in global innovation and problem-solving.\n\nSaudi Arabia's growing diplomatic footprint and rising influence in international affairs mean it has the potential to mediate and resolve many of the world's most pressing conflicts. From the longstanding Israel-Palestine issue to the volatile tensions in the Horn of Africa, Saudi Arabia's ability to engage with all sides and facilitate dialogue could help bring about meaningful peace agreements. As a nation that has long recognized the importance of stability in its region, Saudi Arabia is well-suited to tackle conflicts far beyond the Middle East.\n\nDespite its growing diplomatic stature, Saudi Arabia still faces significant challenges. The Kingdom will need to continue its internal reforms and demonstrate a consistent commitment to peaceful conflict resolution. It must also navigate complex geopolitical dynamics and ensure its neutrality does not alienate any of its key allies. Moreover, as the Kingdom positions itself as a global mediator, it will need to cultivate trust and credibility with the international community, ensuring that its mediation efforts are seen as impartial and genuine.\n\nHowever, if Saudi Arabia can build on its recent successes and maintain its pragmatic, balanced approach, the Kingdom is poised to become one of the world's most influential diplomatic players in the coming decades. Its resources, relationships, and growing diplomatic expertise provide it with the tools to play a pivotal role in fostering peace and stability globally.\n\nIn a world increasingly characterized by division and conflict, Saudi Arabia's efforts to bridge divides and promote dialogue are both timely and necessary. Its recent successes in Ukraine are just the beginning. The Kingdom's growing influence as a global mediator aligns with both its national interests and the broader international objective of achieving lasting peace. If it continues on its current trajectory, Saudi Arabia could very well become one of the world's most important forces for peace in the years ahead.",

Partnerships with nonprofits that could enhance facilities and allow more public access.\n\nSpokane Public Schools and the city park's department are partnering in an ambitious effort to touch every corner of the city in hundreds of small ways and a handful of big ones - and they're hopeful the partnership will convince taxpayers they'll get more juice with less squeeze.\n\nIn sum, the projects could have as significant effect on the trajectory of Spokane as did Expo '74, said school Superintendent Adam Swinyward in a Wednesday interview. Every second-grader would learn to swim, neighborhoods without parks would finally get one or get a much needed facelift to the one they have, and more.\n\nThe two organizations, flanked by a bipartisan group of prominent supporters, formally announced a plan Thursday that has been in the works for months: placing a parks levy and school bond on the same ballot, which would pay for new programs, facilities, parks and schools. There would be at least a few perks for every neighborhood with special attention on the ones that have historically seen little, and the two agencies say they can offer significantly more for less money than if city parks and the school district didn't work together.\n\nOfficials expect both measures to appear on the November ballot, though the parks levy will need to be formally approved by the Spokane City Council and the school bond will need to be approved by the school board, actions anticipated by April at the latest.\n\nThe parks levy would raise $225 million in property taxes over the next 20 years from city taxpayers, at a rate of 27 cents per $1,000 of assessed value. That means the owner of a $400,000 home in Spokane would pay an additional $108 per year.\n\nThe school district will ask voters living within the district to grant the agency authority to issue $200 million in bonds that would need to be paid off over 20 years. Unlike levies, which are collected directly from property taxpayers at a steady clip over the entire life of the levy, bonds are sold to investors at the front end and paid back by the school district over 20 years with interest using property taxes, allowing the money to be quickly raised and used for expensive construction projects. This can mean that the amount taxpayers will spend to pay the debt for a particular bond fluctuates greatly over time, but will be generally more stable overall.\n\nThe district has generally sought a bond every six years since 2003, issuing new ones with voter approval for the next round of projects as it pays down the principal from the prior bonds. As taxpayers continue to pay down debt from two prior bonds approved in 2009 and 2018, district officials have estimated that the new bond would increase tax bills by only around 2 cents per $1,000 of assessed value for 2026 and 2027, rising to 12 cents in 2028.\n\nThis year's bond encompasses all the projects intended on the failed February 2024 bond and then some. All schools will see annual upgrades, from a fresh coat of paint to - in two cases - completely new schools. Swinyard said some intended projects from the February 2024nproposal had to be dialed back, but some were vastly expanded.\n\nIt's difficult for school and park officials to point to a crown jewel in the expansive list of projects they hope to fund through these tax measures, though the most expensive school projects are the replacement of two elementary schools and the remodeling of North Central High School, which were on the list in last year's failed tax plan.\n\nAdams and Madison elementary schools are slated to be razed and replaced with \"community centers that have a variety of functions,\" beyond schooling, Swinyard said.\n\nMadison Elementary, which borders Franklin Park in North Spokane, would be replaced with a building housing the school, as well as after school programs for Boys and Girls Club and a five sport court indoor \"field house.\" One court would be used for school gym during the day and the rest would be publicly accessible and used for Parks and Recreation programs like senior pickleball. These courts are paid for by the Pacific Northwest Qualifier volleyball tournament in exchange for free use during their competitions, with the Spokane Hoopfest Association chipping in another $1 million. Ball fields in the adjacent Franklin Park would get practice lights for nighttime play.\n\nAdams Elementary, a brick South Hill schoolhouse built 1909 that isn't compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act , would see a similar overhaul in the partnership with Boys and Girls Club, though it wouldn't get a Madison-style fieldhouse. Adams is the first priority among the projects for the district.\n\nDuring reconstructions on each of these buildings, which district spokesman Ryan Lancaster estimates would take around a year, kids would temporarily move to other schools. Adams students would learn in the old Jefferson Elementary School, while Madison students would disperse at nearby schools.\n\nNorth Central High School, the last of the district's five high schools to be fully renovated, would see modernizations in its oldest sections. They'll also add a turf football field, baseball and softball fields, all with lights. Sporting areas can be used by school kids and parks programming.\n\nEach of these three projects, Swinyard expects will cost in the $30 to $40 million price range.\n\nChase and Garry Middle Schools would each see updates that wouldn't require students to learn elsewhere during construction.\n\nParks and schools collectively own a 20-acre parcel in Latah Valley. This bond and levy would finance the plans for a future school with an adjacent new park, each to be constructed through future tax asks, likely in 2031.\n\nThe school district plans to use a state -owned building on Spokane Community College campus for a new vocational skill focused high school. Students attending this new school could graduate both with their diploma and a two year technical degree in electrical engineering, fire science or automotive technology, for example.\n\nKids too young for school could also see a payout in this package- the district plans to launch a comprehensive online preschool directory with public and private options for families to find openings for their little ones.\n\nAdjacent to the former site of the Joe Albi Stadium is the city owned Dwight Merkel Sports Complex. Land from each would be merged under this proposal, adding eight all-weather fields to the Merkel complex, two paid for by local soccer clubs. Further updates include lighting for nighttime use, a concessions building and pump track for cyclists.\n\nThough commonplace in schools in Western Washington, Spokane Public Schools doesn't offer swimming as a school sport. That could change, with the district eyeing a \"mothballed\" indoor pool owned by Spokane Community College. In exchange for the school district spending an estimated $1 million to $3 million to renovate the space, the college plans to hand over control of the building for no cost .\n\nAfter updates, the 55-yard pool could be a space where high school teams practice, people with disabilities get swim therapy and every Spokane Public Schools second-grader learns how to swim, with priority for those living north of the river. When schools aren't using the space, the public could reserve it.\n\nThough the Ferris High School building itself wouldn't see any substantial remodeling, nearby campus space would become a varied sports complex, with the addition of three turf fields and baseball infield, plus lights. Spokane Youth Sports Association would pitch in to building costs and share use of the space.\n\nShadle Park High School drew the attention of the United States Tennis Association, which plans to fund the costs to build new indoor courts on the school's campus in an effort to revitalize the sport. The association, which hosts the U.S. Open, plans to finance a 10-court indoor tennis facility. School tennis teams would get priority, followed by city programs.\n\nTo make easier the scheduling and use of the more-than 230 projects the two separate ballot items would fund, the entities plan to launch a website, \"facilitron,\" for residents to book spaces and peruse programs from the schools and parks.\n\nEach high schools' grass sports field would be accessible in all weather and all seasons with the addition of turf and bright lights.\n\nIf voters agree to give Spokane parks another $225 million over the next 20 years - or roughly $11.5 million per year - it would be the first systemwide investment in neighborhood parks since 1999, according to the Park Board.\n\nSpokane's park officials have promised three new neighborhood parks, significantly increasing the areas of the city where it is possible to walk from any particular home to the nearest public park within 10 minutes.\n\nTwo of these parks would be located in some of the northernmost reaches of the city, including in North Indian Trail to the northwest and Shiloh Hills to the northeast.\n\nThe third site announced by the city Thursday would be in the Latah/Hangman Neighborhood on what is currently undeveloped land immediately across the highway from the Qualchan Golf Course, though it's not coming in the next few years. Local leaders hope to build a park on the north side and an elementary on the south side of this property, though the school district will not immediately be able to afford to build the school, so the agencies would pause on developing either both can be built simultaneously, likely in the 2030s.\n\nImprovements to park properties would be nearly ubiquitous under the proposal. Park officials promise increased daily maintenance, increasing the number of commissioned park rangers from four to as many as 12, renovations or replacements to everyone of the city's 85 park bathrooms, improvements to five local trailheads, and the development of six outdoor learning centers.\n\nParks officials have said every park in the city will receive some attention with the levy funding, but will target three \"deteriorating\" parks for full overhauls and renovations. This includes Grant Park, located next to Grant Elementary in the East Central Neighborhood, Harmon Field and Skate Park, located immediately west of the North Spokane Corridor in the Hillyard Neighborhood, and Minnehaha Park in the northeastern corner of the Minnehaha Neighborhood.\n\nUpgrading Minnehaha, which opens to an expansive trail system on Beacon Hill, has been of particular interest to Councilman Michael Cathcart, who has argued the area needs a major park that can act as a community hub and pushed for the parks levy to move forward last year as originally scheduled.\n\n\"If anyone has spent any time in the parks in northeast Spokane, it is embarrassing,\" Cathcart said last April shortly before the levy was delayed for a second time, an action he opposed at the time.\n\nToday, most of the Museum of Arts and Culture's campus in Browne's Addition isn't dedicated to exhibits and displays - it's dedicated to storage for the many artifacts in its collection. What is open to the public tends to be filled by traveling exhibits, like the current \"Samurai, Sunrise, Sunset\" exhibit which is on display until May 4, and not the MAC's own extensive archives.\n\n\"All of our local history is in storage at their current site,\" Swinyard said in a recent interview. \"All of our indigenous culture, pioneer culture, urbanization culture - all those artifacts are not available to the community because they don't have any exhibit space.\"\n\nOne project proposed by the Spokane School District and the city's parks department is an offsite storage facility with support and funding from the MAC that the three organizations could share, freeing up approximately 25,000 square feet of the museum's storage space for public displays. The MAC would support design and construction costs through state grants over the next two years, Swinyard said.\n\nPark and school officials have come to the public hand-in-hand, pitching voters on a partnership that could touch every corner of the city in myriad small and some significant ways.\n\nThey argue that the partnership means taxpayers get more for less money than if the two went it alone, which may convince voters to be more favorable toward the Spokane school district's bond than last year. Advocates point to the successful dual campaigns in 2018 between the $495 million school bond and the $77 million library levy as proof that such a partnership could be successful.\n\nBut voters will still be confronted with two separate items on their ballots, begging the question: what happens if one fails?\n\nThe ask from parks, being a levy, only needs the approval of a majority of voters to pass. The school district's bond, however, requires 60% under state law. When the district asked voters to approve a bond last February, it failed with around 56% of the vote.\n\nThe plans for Spokane's schools and parks have become so deeply entwined that it is difficult to tease out exactly what either entity would accomplish and on what timetable if voters approve only one of the two ballot measures.\n\nIf only the parks levy were approved, some of the proposed projects would proceed anyway. For example, the two entities have proposed building a new park and a new elementary school on the same parcel of land in the Latah Valley.\n\nIf both the parks levy and the school bond were approved, the school district still would not have enough funding from the bond to build the school, so in the near term the agencies would pay to plan both projects. If the school district's next bond in approximately six years were approved, both the park and school would be built at that time, which officials from both agencies believe would keep costs down on both projects.\n\nBut there is enough money in this year's parks levy for the Latah Valley park to be built, according to parks and recreation spokeswoman Fianna Dickson. If the school bond failed, construction of that park would proceed anyway, and in that case without consideration to the school's next funding cycle.\n\nIf that example seems complicated, it may be one of the simpler ones to break apart if the partnership can't proceed.\n\nThe school district can still refer to the plan it proposed for the money it would have received from the failed 2024 bond, and the city parks department can turn to the original plans it created when the agency believed it was going it alone. Either agency can still march forward if the other fails, but not without difficulty.\n\n\"There's certain elements that would still happen, but when you look at those 33 featured projects, those will not happen if one of these fails,\" said Garrett Jones, city parks director in a recent interview. \"If the school district can build (the Merkel Sports Complex expansion), but the parks levy fails, then we can't operate it and that project can't pencil out.\"\n\nAnother potential complication for both requests: the possibility of a new jail bond.\n\nIn 2023, Spokane County voters resoundingly rejected a 30-year, $1.7 billion bond that would have paid for, among other things, two new jails. While no concrete plan has formed, officials expect the county will likely eventually go back to voters.\n\nThe city parks levy has been delayed three times, twice out of concern that it would land on the same ballot as a major tax ask and frustrate a financially strained electorate. The third time, in November, it was the Spokane parks board that proposed the delay, arguing that a partnership with the schools was worth the wait. Councilman Michael Cathcart, however, raised concerns at the time that this last delay could land both the parks levy, which he has been a major advocate for, and the school bond on a ballot where it could be dwarfed by a jail measure.\n\nAsked Wednesday how the two agencies would respond if this happened, Swinyard suggested a new jail proposal would need more time to bake before it was put to voters, but while \"that would not be our ideal ballot scenario, we would move forward.\"",

Champion announced the economic impact of this week's show, on Riyadh and Saudi Arabia, will be a mammoth US$820 million.\n\nChampion insisted there is more to come, stating the event and the robust partnership with the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT) and SAFCSP will continue taking giant strides forward, as he announced a US$80m tenancy agreement to continue bringing Tahaluf mega-events, such as LEAP; world-renowned real estate expo Cityscape Global; CPHI, the Middle East's leading pharma event; and global fintech platform Money20/20, to Malham for the next four years.\n\nChampion said: \"As we close the curtain on another incredible edition of LEAP, the realisation of how impactful these events are to the Kingdom is truly eye-opening. Through our events since 2022 we have realised an economic impact of US$10 billion to the Saudi economy, with this set to reach US$20 billion by 2027.\n\n\"We have also committed to a US$80 million tenancy here in Malham over a four-year term that will allow us, along with our partners SELA, to keep improving this venue and make it a truly world-class experience for the millions of visitors we will be attracting across our events in the lifespan of the agreement.\"\n\nAnnabelle Mander, Executive Vice President of Tahaluf, joined Champion on stage to announce the organisers had delivered on their promise of delivering quality, revealing LEAP 2025 had welcomed 825 first-time exhibitors and more than 1,900 investors - 74 per cent of whom travelled to Riyadh from overseas - with a combined US$22 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM), representing a 400 percent year-on-year increase.\n\n\"The robust increase in our international market presence year-on-year, further cements LEAP's status as a deal-making hub,\" said Mander. \"We have also exceeded all previous editions on confirmed and committed onsite investments, with this year totalling over US$15 billion across AI, data centre expansions, and smart energy sector growth. I would like to thank all our partners who put their trust in us and see the incredible benefits LEAP offers as a platform to announce such critical regional and international partnerships.\"\n\nAI is an Ecosystem That is Redefining Government and Industries and Leadership, says PwC Chairman\n\nArtificial Intelligence is an ecosystem redefining everything from government administration and industries, to business leadership and everyday innovation. So it is imperative people are educated not to fear it, but rather trust its potential, according to Mohamed Kande, global chairman of PwC, one of the world's largest professional services companies.\n\nTalking on the LEAP 2025 main stage on the final day of an action-packed four-day event, Kande outlined how emerging technologies, including AI, are redefining industries. He cited the example of technology's convergence with healthcare, referring to a smart ring on his finger which captures personal health data.\n\n\"We are finding that participants in industries are very different to what they used to be,\" said Kande. \"Technology companies are now involved in many different industries. Take the example of how we feed ourselves. In agribusiness, we now have technology businesses heavily invested. What technology has done is to converge industries. The competition now, looking at where they can add value, is very different to what it used to be. Technology is reshaping how businesses and governments are providing their services.\"\n\nElaborating on the construct that AI \"is a convergence of the physical and digital\", the PwC boss used the example of physical data centres, which house digital technology, yet one of the major things needed to allow data centres to work is cooling equipment, which is physical.\n\n\"AI really is an ecosystem,\" he said. \"You have digital and physical coming together to deliver the intelligence. No country has the capability to deliver all components of the AI ecosystem, and that is a big goal for Saudi Arabia.\n\nHe then told attendees that one of the biggest barriers to realising the true benefits of AI is human distrust: \"Trust is the commodity of business. Without it, consumers do not purchase the products, and it's the same with AI. People still fear artificial intelligence. People fear what they don‎'t understand. You have to help people understand, so they can trust us. AI is not going to replace humans; we have to show them what they can use it for. Transparency is key.\"\n\nAsked for his advice on how business leaders should be approaching AI adoption, Kande added: \"We have all been trained to run businesses in a certain way - better, faster, cheaper. Now we have to do things differently. It's no longer a game where we have to provide the answers, it's a game of experimentation. You cannot delegate learning. It's no longer a game of faster, better, cheaper, it's a game of choices. You might make mistakes, but we need different leadership skills.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jerry Inzerillo, Group CEO, Diriyah Gate, told delegates how his team are using technology to make the 14 million square-metre development run and \"make life better than it was the day before\".\n\nInsisting there are often \"too many buzzwords\" when it comes to technology, the hospitality and tourism leader told the audience how, through partnerships with companies such as STC, Diriyah Gate is implementing smart cities technology to enhance sustainability, livability, walkability, and improve quality of life for its residents, visitors, and wildlife, adding how the planting and caring of millions of trees has resulted in the influx of bird species.\n\nDiriyah is, he said, \"a cultural hub above, and a smart city below\". He added: \"When you look after a project the size of Geneva, you have to be efficient and we are very fortunate to have a team of people who make our technology systems talk to one another.\"\n\nMoneyball 2.0: The Next Era of Sports Investments\n\nAs the global sports industry continues to grow exponentially, investors are playing a pivotal role in shaping its future, according to a leading global sports investor. Speaking at the Sports Tech Arena, Finn Hatherell, Venture Partner at BVP, discussed opportunities in sports investments, from venture capital in emerging sports tech to strategic investments in leagues, teams, and esports.\n\n\"One thing to be aware of in the sector is that sport is a highly cyclical and ever-changing industry, and, from what I've seen with early-stage sports tech companies, selling to elite organisations is not that straightforward,\" he said. \"I had one company recently, which, for about two years, was piloting its technology at Liverpool Football Club. It was an AI software that helped athletes optimise their training and prevent injuries by showing them how to do exercises and training efficiently.\n\n\"After two years, it got to the stage where the club wanted to onboard the tech full-time. I don't know if anybody remembers what happened last year, but Jurgen Klopp sadly resigned, and with that comes a whole S&C coach, a new head of sports, a new head of training. So suddenly, this football club that you've been working with has changed completely, and you're dealing with new personnel.\n\n\"One thing I've noticed about sales cycles in sports tech is that they are highly unpredictable. It can be difficult selling to the world's top sports clubs as a lot is left to chance, but it also can be highly lucrative at the same time.\"\n\nFor more information on the event and ticket options, visit onegiantleap.com\n\nAbout LEAP:\n\nSaudi Arabia's desire to shoot for something beyond the realms of the possible presents the ultimate backdrop for LEAP.\n\nLEAP showcases the Kingdom's technology ambition on a global stage as it continues to grow as a hub connecting three continents.

Technology has catalysed Saudi Arabia as the biggest success story in youth and female empowerment in the 21st Century, and we are laser-focused on continuing that success story. The intelligence age is here and, in partnership with you, we are going to take that leap together.\"\n\nMichael Champion, CEO of Tahaluf, which co-organises LEAP with the Saudi Ministry for Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) and the Saudi Federation for Cybersecurity, Programming, and Drones (SAFCSP), added: \"The massive volume of new investments announced on day one builds on the progress made at LEAP and across the Kingdom in previous years, reaffirming Saudi Arabia's undisputed status as the primary digital accelerator in the Middle East and North Africa.\"\n\nIBM's Arvind Kirshna Predicts Quantum Computing Breakthrough now only \"Three to Five Years Away\"\n\nEleven months after announcing IBM's plans to invest US$250 million into a global software development centre in the Kingdom, Arvind Krishna, Chairman & CEO of IBM, joined HE Alswaha on the LEAP Main Stage to discuss his experiences identifying \"early signals\" to stay ahead of emerging industry trends.\n\nThe trend that dominated the duo's conversation was quantum computing - a type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems that would take classical computers millions of years to complete - with Kirishna adamant the technology is getting ever closer.\n\n\"A breakthrough I think is only about three-to-five years in the future is quantum computing - I think we will see something amazing,\" said Krishna. \"We're very excited to already be working on it with some partners in the Kingdom, but I believe quantum computing will open up areas that, for the Kingdom, will be very exciting. It will all be about materials, energy, oil and gas, possibly pharmaceuticals - all areas that are critical to the Kingdom and very much part of Vision 2030.\"\n\nFrom Virtual Boxing to Futuristic Couture, Inaugural Tech Arena Opens Window to the Future\n\nLEAP's newly-added Tech Arena kicked off with a series of future-focused, interactive sessions highlighting some of the latest technological advancements shaping the technology of tomorrow.\n\nWith groundbreaking prototypes in robotics, AI, fashion tech, and mixed reality all being explored, live demonstrations were conducted by global tech influencers alongside BBC Click presenters Lara Lewington and Spencer Kelly.\n\nUS-based Engine VR showcased Golden Gloves VR, a platform that uses virtual reality technology to provide an immersive, gamified boxing experience for fitness enthusiasts, professional athletes, and entertainment seekers.\n\nWith professional boxer David Perez delivering a live demonstration to watching crowds, Aaron Sloan, the platform's Founder, said: \" I used to work as a cardiac nurse, but the only two things I ever really cared about were boxing and technology. So, I quit my nursing job and opened up my own boxing gym; it burned down within a month. It made me realise that building a business in a brick-and-mortar facility was going to be really hard. It just so happened that, around this time, the Quest One headset came out. Not only was it powerful, it was also wireless, which is so crucial for our system to work,\" said Sloan.\n\n\"In order for us to get the traction we needed, we had to replicate as best we could what trainers and boxers were doing in the gym. After a number of different variations, we now have a platform that is being used by sporting bodies across the world, including the Olympics. The system also allows people of determination to take part, making the sport far more inclusive.\"\n\nElsewhere, TJ Rhodes, the Senior Research Scientist and Engineer on Adobe's Project Primrose, talked audiences through the Middle East debut of its latest wearable technology. First premiered at Adobe Max in 2023, the Project Primrose dress uses non-emissive textiles and can change the way we merge fashion and technology.\n\n\"It has so many use cases beyond the catwalk; it can be a canvas for new designs or even a low-power billboard that can flash text-based advertisements,\" said Rhodes. \"It is also a non-emissive material that can be cut to any shape and dynamically diffuses light. Most special effects can only be experienced on the big screen, but what Project Primrose allows us to do is transform it from the big screen to reality. Imagine if Elsa from Frozen was able to transform her dress to match her actions in a live performance. We're still discovering the possibilities of what this technology can do.\"\n\nMore than 1,800 tech brands and 680 start-ups are exhibiting at LEAP 2025 this week, alongside a stellar lineup of 1,000-plus expert speakers across 15 stages, highlighting the tech that is shaping tomorrow.\n\nFor more information on the event and ticket options, visit onegiantleap.com\n\nAbout LEAP:\n\nSaudi Arabia's desire to shoot for something beyond the realms of the possible presents the ultimate backdrop for LEAP.\n\nLEAP showcases the Kingdom's technology ambition on a global stage as it continues to grow as a hub connecting three continents.

        "body": "In our lifetime, sports technology has developed faster and with greater impact than ever could have been imagined, writes Rob Hartnett.\n\nWhere once the electronic stopwatch was deemed cutting edge, now we are surrounded by ways to improve performance, officiating and the viewing of sport.\n\nResearch by Teneo unveiled at the Sport for Business Sporting Year Ahead in January found that the adoption of wearable fitness technology has almost doubled from 30% to 59% among 18- to 24-year-olds and risen from 28% to 42% among the general population.\n\nOver 80% of us say we are motivated by these devices to be healthier and to exercise more.\n\nWhether it is Google's Fitbit or the athlete favourite WHOOP, there is an incredible amount of data being willingly transferred in exchange for a better known self.\n\nAthletes and coaches can use wearable data to monitor workload, ensuring they are training within optimal intensity zones to prevent overtraining or injury.\n\nSubstitutions in football, rugby and Gaelic games are determined by screen data as opposed to the eye test in many matches.\n\nThe small box stitched into the jersey is the most objective judge when it comes to player fatigue.\n\nMetrics like VO2 max and lactate threshold would have been a foreign language to Jack Charlton or Mick O'Dwyer, but now they are essential parts of the virtual kitbag at a manager's disposal, and ours as viewers.\n\nThe trackers also allow coaches and pundits to analyse positional play and movement efficiency on the pitch in myriad ways.\n\nCoupled with advances in data analytics and AI, we are nearing a point where prediction of future results is wonderfully, or dangerously, close.\n\nDECISION MAKING\n\nVideo Assistant Referee (Var) technology has revolutionised how decisions are made in critical moments.\n\nVar uses multiple camera angles to analyse key incidents, such as offside calls, potential penalties and red card offences.\n\nBy reviewing decisions in real time, each technology ensures a greater degree of accuracy, reducing the influence of human error, and making the sport fairer, if slower.\n\nIn tennis, Hawk-Eye is used to determine whether a ball is in or out, providing instant feedback with an accuracy rate of up to 99.99%.\n\nFITNESS AND INJURY PREVENTION\n\nAdvances in biomechanics and sensor technology are enabling athletes to refine their technique with pinpoint precision.\n\nDevices such as smart insoles and motion-capture suits provide detailed feedback on movement patterns, helping athletes to identify inefficiencies and reduce the risk of injury.\n\nCurative medicine is now being matched by preventative knowledge and understanding and we are benefiting in regular life by this as much as in the high performance arena.\n\nFUTURE OF SPORTS TECHNOLOGY\n\nLooking ahead, the role of technology in sports is only set to expand.\n\nInnovations in virtual and augmented reality are already being used to enhance training.\n\nMovement into tackles in rugby or the NFL can be replicated without the physical wear and tear, potentially making sport safer as well as assisting longer careers\n\nBUSINESS BENEFITS\n\nThere is a real business benefit for companies on the cutting edge of this brave new world, and Ireland has been to the fore.\n\nSTATSports has stayed true to its Newry roots while working with teams and players from the Premier League to the NBA and the NFL Output Sports has developed from a UCD spin-out out to listing Patrick Mahomes and Jon Rahm among the stars to use their technology.\n\nKitman Labs has grown an Irish startup to a major base in the US, while Stats Perform has come the opposite direction -- creating hundreds of jobs in Limerick covering the information used by media to tell data stories on the Super Bowl and the Fifa World Cup.\n\nEnterprise Ireland has been an enthusiastic backer of companies in the space of performance, injury prevention and broadcast.\n\nSport Ireland hosts an annual innovation conference and TU Dublin has a postgraduate diploma entering its second year spreading knowledge on technology in sport.\n\nTechnology is seen by some as the enemy of physical activity, but the reality is that we are moving more as a result of the phone in our hand nudging us to do so.\n\nWe are moving smarter with technology guiding us to better technique and better outcomes.",
